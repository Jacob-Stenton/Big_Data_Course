A bot is any automated process - a system which work periodically, like displaying the weather at a particular time of day, every day; or a system which responds to something whenever it happens, like replying to a Tweet with a particular hashtag.

Bots can be:

- Chatbots: Bots that simulate human conversation by responding to certain phrases with programmed responses
- Web crawlers or Spiders (Googlebots): Web crawlers, or spiders, are search engine bots that scan and index webpages on the internet. They help search engines to produce a better search experience by extracting data to understand the structure and relevance of web content.
- Scrapers : Scrapers, or web scraping crawlers, scan and download specific content on the internet.
- Social bots: Bots that operate on social media platforms
- Shop bots: Bots that look online for the best prices 
- Monitoring bots: Bots that can be used to monitor the health of a website or system.
- Transaction bots: Bots that are designed to simplify tasks e.g confirming payment details 
- Malicious bots: Bots that scrape content, spread spam content, or carry out credential stuffing attacks

> Eliza is a pattern-matching automated psychiatrist. Given a set of rules in the form of input/output patterns, Eliza will attempt to recognize user input phrases and generate relevant psychobabble responses.

We are going to have a play with a version of ELIZA made by DH Connelly [from here](http://dhconnelly.com/paip-python/docs/paip/eliza.html) which was based on a version by Peter Nordvig from _"Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming"_.

You can also [play with ELIZA online here](https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html)
