| Unit Title | Creative Making: Big Data, The Self and Social Platforms |
| Unit Code | IU000117 |
| Unit briefing date |  15 February 2024 |
| Duration | Weeks 16-30 |
| Credits | 20 |
| Programme | Creative Computing Institute (CCI), BSc (Hons) Creative Computing |
| Unit Introduction | Please read the Learning Materials that accompany this document. This may include project briefs, unit guidelines, glossary, additional reading lists or event and presentation information. This information will be published together on Moodle. <br><br>In this unit we explore how we can creatively use the ever-increasing data flows we createthrough our social interaction with computational systems. You will develop creativepractice by extending the python and web development skills in the prior units and produce work that visualises a novel data set in a dynamic context.<br><br>You will also be introduced to the practice of artists and designers who have worked with complex data in order to understand what the current state of data-based arts practice is. You will be encouraged to explore the changing nature of self in our increasingly quantified world and a critical dimension to the practice you develop will be actively encouraged.<br><br> You will be encouraged to use various forms of presenting artworks that “talk” about data using several different possibilities, which may include textiles, sculpting, 3D modelling and fine art techniques, amongst others.|

### Further Information
During the course of the unit, you will develop a single creative project. Some examples of projects/areas of interests which would meet the expectations for this brief are:
1. An installation which is based on, or represents a large dataset you have scraped.
2. A web-crawler which continually collects and stores data with a visual display of the
data collected.
3. Web-scraping software which collects and stores large amounts of data, which is
processed, analysed and the findings visualised.
4. A Twitter bot with a limitless lifespan which users can communicate with.
5. An automated software-based system which continually polls a web-based API for
data and visualizes the data.
6. A bot which exists within a social network, using sentiment analysis to assess tone
and make contact.
7. A physical manifestation of an online data source.
8. An application that visually reflects the constantly changing landscape of an online
news aggregator.
9. A visualisation of interconnected users and communities on a social media network
from data you have scraped and analysed.
This project is an opportunity for you to explore an idea in depth, both technically and
conceptually. Your project must be creative and involve Big Data in some way, whether it’s
data you have scraped and cleaned yourself, or using a pre-existing body of data you have
found. Your project has to include a web-based experiment - a bot, a scraper, a dynamic
website, or experimental use of an API. Conceptually, this could also be about social
media, platforms, the self, online data, internet culture, memes, hacktivism, internet of
things, or another related theme. You can develop the idea starting with an API or web
scraping experiment, or start with a more conceptual or web-interventionist idea, then work
out how this could manifest


### Documentation expectations
Your documentation must include your research, ideas, development, technical solutions, screenshots and visuals, final outcome, and reflections. Your documentation should show that you have considered how and why this data is interesting to you.

You can document the project as you prefer (using markdown files on GitHub, a blog, a PDF, etc.). You are encouraged to use a Github repository to store all project data and information, but you can submit a zip file of the offline project if you prefer.

It is important that you document your project as it progresses – this includes failures and experiments, as well as successes.

If your project is entirely online, simply providing a link to the Github repo(s) and blog in a text file in your submitted zip file. Please be considerate of how you organise your work in a repo – this includes file/folder names, keeping relevant files together, keeping each distinct experiment separate from the others etc.

Your submission should include a 3-5 minute video presentation of your project, containing:
- A brief description of your idea and objectives,
- A video of your project working with the code running,
- Video documentation of the final outcome,
- A brief explanation of your code.
- 
If you don’t feel comfortable talking in the video, please feel free to provide subtitles.
The presentation should be available to download in .mp4 or .mov format, or to watch online. You can include it in the .zip file, in the Github repository, or provide an external link.
