Under existing\\r\\ncircumstances, women of character and social position avoid the gardens\\r\\nand terraces of Gray\\'s Inn and the Temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttended by men, or protected by circumstances that guard them from\\r\\nimpertinence and scandal, gentlewomen can without discomfort pass and\\r\\nrepass the walls of our legal colleges; but in most cases a lady enters\\r\\nthem under conditions that announce even to casual passers the object of\\r\\nher visit. In her carriage, during the later hours of the day, a\\r\\nbarrister\\'s wife may drive down the Middle Temple Lane, or through the\\r\\ngate of Lincoln\\'s Inn, and wait in King\\'s Bench Walk or New Square,\\r\\nuntil her husband, putting aside clients and papers, joins her for the\\r\\nhomeward drive. But even thus placed, sitting in her carriage and\\r\\nguarded by servants, she usually prefers to fence off inquisitive eyes\\r\\nby a bonnet-veil, or the blinds of her carriage-windows. On Sunday, the\\r\\nwives and daughters of gentle families brighten the dingy passages of\\r\\nthe Temple, and the sombre courts of Lincoln\\'s Inn: for the musical\\r\\nservices of the grand church and little chapel, are amongst the\\r\\nreligious entertainments of the town. To those choral celebrations\\r\\nladies go, just as they are accustomed to enter any metropolitan church;\\r\\nand after service they can take a turn in the gardens of either Society,\\r\\nwithout drawing upon themselves unpleasant attention. So also,\\r\\nunattended by men, ladies are permitted to inspect the floral\\r\\nexhibitions with which Mr. Broome, the Temple gardener, annually\\r\\nentertains London sightseers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, save on these and a few similar occasions and conditions,\\r\\ngentlewomen avoid an Inn of Court as they would a barrack-yard, unless\\r\\nthey have secured the special attendance of at least one member of the\\r\\nsociety. The escort of a barrister or student, alters the case. What\\r\\nbarrister, young or old, cannot recall mirthful eyes that, with quick\\r\\nshyness, have turned away from his momentary notice, as in answer to the\\r\\nrustling of silk, or stirred by sympathetic consciousness of women\\'s\\r\\nnoiseless presence, he has raised his face from a volume of reports, and\\r\\nseen two or three timorous girls peering through the golden haze of a\\r\\nLondon morning, into the library of his Inn? What man, thus drawn away\\r\\nfor thirty seconds from prosaic toil, has not in that half minute\\r\\nremembered the faces of happy rural homes,--has not recalled old days\\r\\nwhen his young pulses beat cordial welcome to similar intruders upon the\\r\\nstillness of the Bodleian, or the tranquil seclusion of Trinity library?\\r\\nWhat occupant of dreary chambers in the Temple, reading this page,\\r\\ncannot look back to a bright day, when young, beautiful, and pure as\\r\\nsanctity, Lilian, or Kate, or Olive, entered his room radiant with\\r\\nsmiles, delicate in attire, and musical with gleesome gossip about\\r\\ncountry neighbors, and the life of a joyous home?\\r\\n\\r\\nSeldom does a Templar of the present generation receive so fair and\\r\\ninnocent a visitor. To him the presence of a gentlewoman in his court,\\r\\nis an occasion for ingenious conjecture; encountered on his staircase\\r\\nshe is a cause of lively astonishment. His guests are men, more or less\\r\\naddicted to tobacco; his business callers are solicitors and their\\r\\nclerks; in his vestibule the masculine emissaries of tradesmen may\\r\\nsometimes be found--head-waiters from neighboring taverns, pot-boys from\\r\\nthe \\'Cock\\' and the \\'Rainbow.\\' A printer\\'s devil may from time to time\\r\\nknock at his door. But of women--such women as he would care to mention\\r\\nto his mother and sisters--he sees literally nothing in his dusty,\\r\\nill-ordered, but not comfortless rooms. He has a laundress, one of a\\r\\nclass on whom contemporary satire has been rather too severe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeminine life of another sort lurks in the hidden places of the law\\r\\ncolleges, shunning the gaze of strangers by daylight; and even when it\\r\\ncreeps about under cover of night, trembling with a sense of its own\\r\\nincurable shame. But of this sad life, the bare thought of which sends a\\r\\nshivering through the frame of every man whom God has blessed with a\\r\\npeaceful home and wholesome associations, nothing shall be said in this\\r\\npage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn past time the life of law-colleges was very different in this\\r\\nrespect. When they ceased to be ecclesiastics, and fixed themselves in\\r\\nthe hospices which soon after the reception of the gowned tenants, were\\r\\nstyled Inns of Courts; our lawyers took unto themselves wives, who were\\r\\nboth fair and discreet. And having so made women flesh of their flesh\\r\\nand bone of their bone, they brought them to homes within the immediate\\r\\nvicinity of their collegiate walls, and sometimes within the walls\\r\\nthemselves. Those who would appreciate the life of the Inns in past\\r\\ncenturies, and indeed in times within the memory of living men, should\\r\\nbear this in mind. When he was not on circuit, many a counsellor learned\\r\\nin the law, found the pleasures not less than the business of his\\r\\nexistence within the bounds of his \\'honorable society.\\' In the fullest\\r\\nsense of the words, he took his ease in his Inn; besides being his\\r\\nworkshop, where clients flocked to him for advice, it was his club, his\\r\\nplace of pastime, and the shrine of his domestic affections. In this\\r\\ngeneration a successful Chancery barrister, or Equity draftsman, looks\\r\\nupon Lincoln\\'s Inn merely as a place of business, where at a prodigious\\r\\nrent he holds a set of rooms in which he labors over cases, and\\r\\nsatisfies the demands of clients and pupils. A century or two centuries\\r\\nsince the case was often widely different. The rising barrister brought\\r\\nhis bride in triumph to his \\'chambers,\\' and in them she received the\\r\\nfriends who hurried to congratulate her on her new honors. In those\\r\\nrooms she dispensed graceful hospitality, and watched her husband\\'s\\r\\ntoils. The elder of her children first saw the light in those narrow\\r\\nquarters; and frequently the lawyer, over his papers, was disturbed by\\r\\nthe uproar of his heir in an adjoining room.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung wives, the mistresses of roomy houses in the western quarters of\\r\\ntown, shudder as they imagine the discomforts which these young wives of\\r\\nother days must have endured. \"What! live in chambers?\" they exclaim\\r\\nwith astonishment and horror, recalling the smallness and cheerless\\r\\naspect of their husbands\\' business chambers. But past usages must not be\\r\\nhastily condemned,--allowance must be made for the fact that our\\r\\nancestors set no very high price on the luxuries of elbow-room and\\r\\nbreathing-room. Families in opulent circumstances were wont to dwell\\r\\nhappily, and receive whole regiments of jovial visitors in little houses\\r\\nnigh the Strand and Fleet Street, Ludgate Hill and Cheapside;--houses\\r\\nhidden in narrow passages and sombre courts--houses, compared with\\r\\nwhich the lowliest residences in a \"genteel suburb\" of our own time\\r\\nwould appear capacious mansions. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that\\r\\nthe married barrister, living a century since with his wife in\\r\\nchambers--either within or hard-by an Inn or Court--was, at a\\r\\ncomparatively low rent, the occupant of far more ample quarters than\\r\\nthose for which a working barrister now-a-days pays a preposterous sum.\\r\\nSuch a man was tenant of a \\'set of rooms\\' (several rooms, although\\r\\ncalled \\'a chamber\\') which, under the present system, accommodates a\\r\\nsmall colony of industrious \\'juniors\\' with one office and a clerk\\'s room\\r\\nattached. Married ladies, who have lived in Paris or Vienna, in the \\'old\\r\\ntown\\' of Edinburgh, or Victoria Street, Westminster, need no assurance\\r\\nthat life \\'on a flat\\' is not an altogether deplorable state of\\r\\nexistence. The young couple in chambers had six rooms at their\\r\\ndisposal,--a chamber for business, a parlor, not unfrequently a\\r\\ndrawing-room, and a trim, compact little kitchen. Sometimes they had two\\r\\n\\'sets of rooms,\\' one above another; in which case the young wife could\\r\\nhave her bridesmaids to stay with her, or could offer a bed to a friend\\r\\nfrom the country. Occasionally during the last fifty years of the last\\r\\ncentury, they were so fortunate as to get possession of a small detached\\r\\nhouse, originally built by a nervous bencher, who disliked the sound of\\r\\nfootsteps on the stairs outside his door. Time was when the Inns\\r\\ncomprised numerous detached houses, some of them snug dwellings, and\\r\\nothers imposing mansions, wherein great dignitaries lived with proper\\r\\nostentation. Most of them have bean pulled down, and their sites covered\\r\\nwith collegiate \\'buildings;\\' but a few of them still remain, the grand\\r\\npiles having long since been partitioned off into chambers, and the\\r\\nlittle houses striking the eye as quaint, misplaced, insignificant\\r\\nblocks of human habitation. Under the trees of Gray\\'s Inn gardens may\\r\\nbe seen two modest tenements, each of them comprising some six or eight\\r\\nrooms and a vestibule. At the present time they are occupied as offices\\r\\nby legal practitioners, and many a day has passed since womanly taste\\r\\ndecorated their windows with flowers and muslin curtains; but a certain\\r\\nvenerable gentleman, to whom the writer of this page is indebted for\\r\\nmuch information about the lawyers of the last century, can remember\\r\\nwhen each of those cottages was inhabited by a barrister, his young\\r\\nwife, and three or four lovely children. Into some such a house near\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn, a young lawyer who was destined to hold the seals for\\r\\nmany years, and be also the father of a Lord Chancellor, married in the\\r\\nyear of our Lord, 1718. His name was Philip Yorke: and though he was of\\r\\nhumble birth, he had made such a figure in his profession that great\\r\\nmen\\'s doors, were open to him. He was asked to dinner by learned judges,\\r\\nand invited to balls by their ladies. In Chancery Lane, at the house of\\r\\nSir Joseph Jekyll, Master of the Rolls, he met Mrs. Lygon, a beauteous\\r\\nand wealthy widow, whose father was a country squire, and whose mother\\r\\nwas the sister of the great Lord Somers. In fact, she was a lady of such\\r\\nbirth, position, and jointure, that the young lawyer--rising man though\\r\\nhe was--seemed a poor match for her. The lady\\'s family thought so; and\\r\\nif Sir Joseph Jekyll had not cordially supported the suitor with a\\r\\nletter of recommendation, her father would have rejected him as a man\\r\\ntoo humble in rank and fortune. Having won the lady and married her, Mr.\\r\\nPhilip Yorke brought her home to a \\'very small house\\' near Lincoln\\'s\\r\\nInn; and in that lowly dwelling, the ground-floor of which was the\\r\\nbarrister\\'s office, they spent the first years of their wedded life.\\r\\nWhat would be said of the rising barrister who, now-a-days, on his\\r\\nmarriage with a rich squire\\'s rich daughter and a peer\\'s niece, should\\r\\npropose to set up his household gods in a tiny crip just outside\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn gate, and to use the parlor of the \\'very small house\\' for\\r\\nprofessional purposes? Far from being guilty of unseemly parsimony in\\r\\nthis arrangement, Philip Yorke paid proper consideration to his wife\\'s\\r\\nsocial advantages, in taking her to a separate house. His contemporaries\\r\\namongst the junior bar would have felt no astonishment if he had fitted\\r\\nup a set of chambers for his wealthy and well-descended bride. Not\\r\\nmerely in his day, but for long years afterward, lawyers of gentle birth\\r\\nand comfortable means, who married women scarcely if at all inferior to\\r\\nMrs. Yorke in social condition, lived upon the flats of Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\nand the Temple.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LAST OF THE LADIES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever its drawbacks, the system which encouraged the young barrister\\r\\nto marry on a modest income, and make his wife \\'happy in chambers,\\' must\\r\\nhave had special advantages. In their Inn the husband was near every\\r\\nsource of diversion for which he greatly cared, and the wife was\\r\\nsurrounded by the friends of either sex in whose society she took most\\r\\npleasure--friends who, like herself, \\'lived in the Inn,\\' or in one of\\r\\nthe immediately adjacent streets. In \\'hall\\' he dined and drank wine with\\r\\nhis professional compeers and the wits of the bar: the \\'library\\'\\r\\nsupplied him not only with law books, but with poems and dramas, with\\r\\nmerry trifles written for the stage, and satires fresh from the Row;\\r\\n\\'the chapel\\'--or if he were a Templer, \\'the church\\'--was his habitual\\r\\nplace of worship, where there were sittings for his wife and children\\r\\nas well as for himself; on the walks and under the shady trees of \\'the\\r\\ngarden\\' he sauntered with his own, or, better still, a friend\\'s wife,\\r\\ncriticising the passers, describing the new comedy, or talking over the\\r\\nlast ball given by a judge\\'s lady. At times those gardens were pervaded\\r\\nby the calm of collegiate seclusion, but on \\'open days\\' they were brisk\\r\\nwith life. The women and children of the legal colony walked in them\\r\\ndaily; the ladies attired in their newest fashions, and the children\\r\\nrunning with musical riot over lawns and paths. Nor were the grounds\\r\\nmere places of resort for lawyers and their families. Taking rank\\r\\namongst the pleasant places of the metropolis, they attracted, on \\'open\\r\\ndays,\\' crowds from every quarter of the town--ladies and gallants from\\r\\nSoho Square and St. James\\'s Street, from Whitehall and Westminster;\\r\\nsightseers from the country and gorgeous alderwomic dowagers from\\r\\nCheapside. From the days of Elizabeth till the middle, indeed till the\\r\\nclose, of the eighteenth century the ornamental grounds of the four\\r\\ngreat Inns were places of fashionable promenade, where the rank and\\r\\ntalent and beauty of the town assembled for display and exercise, even\\r\\nas in our own time they assemble (less universally) in Hyde Park and\\r\\nKensington Gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen ladies and children had withdrawn, the quietude of the gardens\\r\\nlured from their chambers scholars and poets, who under murmuring\\r\\nbranches pondered the results of past study, or planned new works. Ben\\r\\nJonson was accustomed to saunter beneath the elms of Lincoln\\'s Inn; and\\r\\nSteele--alike on \\'open\\' and \\'close\\' days--used to frequent the gardens\\r\\nof the same society. \"I went,\" he writes in May, 1809, \"into Lincoln\\'s\\r\\nInn Walks, and having taking a round or two, I sat down, according to\\r\\nthe allowed familiarity of these places, on a bench.\" In the following\\r\\nNovember he alludes to the privilege that he enjoyed of walking there\\r\\nas \"a favor that is indulged me by several of the benchers, who are very\\r\\nintimate friends, and grown in the neighborhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though on certain days, and under fixed regulations, the outside\\r\\npublic were admitted to the college gardens, the assemblages were always\\r\\npervaded by the tone and humor of the law. The courtiers and grand\\r\\nladies from \\'the west\\' felt themselves the guests of the lawyers; and\\r\\nthe humbler folk, who by special grant had acquired the privilege of\\r\\nentry, or whose decent attire and aspect satisfied the janitors of their\\r\\nrespectability, moved about with watchfulness and gravity, surveying the\\r\\ncounsellors and their ladies with admiring eyes, and extolling the\\r\\nbenchers whose benevolence permitted simple tradespeople to take the air\\r\\nside by side with \\'the quality.\\' In 1736, James Ralph, in his \\'New\\r\\nCritical Review of the Publick Buildings,\\' wrote about the square and\\r\\ngardens of Lincoln\\'s Inn in a manner which testifies to the respectful\\r\\ngratitude of the public for the liberality which permitted all outwardly\\r\\ndecent persons to walk in the grounds. \"I may safely add,\" he says,\\r\\n\"that no area anywhere is kept in better order, either for cleanliness\\r\\nand beauty by day, or illumination by night; the fountain in the middle\\r\\nis a very pretty decoration, and if it was still kept playing, as it was\\r\\nsome years ago, \\'twould preserve its name with more propriety.\" In his\\r\\nremarks on the chapel the guide observes, \"The raising this chapel on\\r\\npillars affords a pleasing, melancholy walk underneath, and by night,\\r\\nparticularly, when illuminated by the lamps, it has an effect that may\\r\\nbe felt, but not described.\" Of the gardens Mr. Ralph could not speak in\\r\\nhigh praise, for they were ill-arranged and not so carefully kept as the\\r\\nsquare; but he observes, \"they are convenient; and considering their\\r\\nsituation cannot be esteemed to much. There is something hospitable in\\r\\nlaying them open to public use; and while we share in their pleasures,\\r\\nwe have no title to arraign their taste.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief attraction of Lincoln\\'s Inn gardens, apart from its beautiful\\r\\ntrees, was for many years the terrace overlooking \\'the Fields,\\' which\\r\\nwas made _temp._ Car. II. at the cost of nearly £1000. Dugdale, speaking\\r\\nof the recent improvements of the Inn, says, \"And the last was the\\r\\nenlargement of their garden, beautifying with a large tarras walk on the\\r\\nwest side thereof, and raising the wall higher towards Lincoln\\'s Inne\\r\\nFields, which was done in An. 1663 (15 Car. II.), the charge thereof\\r\\namounting to a little less than a thousand pounds, by reason that the\\r\\nlevelling of most part of the ground, and raising the tarras, required\\r\\nsuch great labor.\" A portion of this terrace, and some of the old trees,\\r\\nwere destroyed to make room for the new dining-hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old system supplied the barrister with other sources of recreation.\\r\\nWithin a stone\\'s throw of his residence was the hotel where his club had\\r\\nits weekly meeting. Either in hall, or with his family, or at a tavern\\r\\nnear \\'the courts,\\' it was his use, until a comparatively recent date, to\\r\\ndine in the middle of the day, and work again after the meal. Courts sat\\r\\nafter dinner as well as before; and it was observable that counsellors\\r\\nspoke far better when they were full of wine and venison than when they\\r\\nstated the case in the earlier part of the day. But in the evening the\\r\\nsystem told especially in the barrister\\'s favor. All his many friends\\r\\nlying within a small circle, he had an abundance of congenial society.\\r\\nBrother-circuiteers came to his wife\\'s drawing-room for tea and chat,\\r\\ncoffee and cards. There was a substantial supper at half-past eight or\\r\\nnine for such guests (supper cooked in my lady\\'s little kitchen, or\\r\\nsupplied by the \\'Society\\'s cook\\'); and the smoking dishes were\\r\\naccompanied by foaming tankards of ale or porter, and followed by\\r\\nsuperb and richly aromatic bowls of punch. On occasions when the learned\\r\\nman worked hard and shut out visitors by sporting his oak, he enjoyed\\r\\nprivacy as unbroken and complete as that of any library in Kensington or\\r\\nTyburnia. If friends stayed away, and he wished for diversion, he could\\r\\nrun into the chambers of old college-chums, or with his wife\\'s gracious\\r\\npermission could spend an hour at Chatelin\\'s or Nando\\'s, or any other\\r\\ncoffeehouse in vogue with members of his profession. During festive\\r\\nseasons, when the judges\\' and leaders\\' ladies gave their grand balls,\\r\\nthe young couple needed no carriage for visiting purposes. From Gray\\'s\\r\\nInn to the Temple they walked--if the weather was fine. When it rained\\r\\nthey hailed a hackney-coach, or my lady was popped into a sedan and\\r\\ncarried by running bearers to the frolic of the hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course the notes of the preceding paragraphs of this chapter are but\\r\\nsuggestions as to the mode in which the artistic reader must call up the\\r\\nlife of the old lawyers. Encouraging him to realize the manners and\\r\\nusages of several centuries, not of a single generation, they do not\\r\\nattempt to entertain the student with details. It is needless to say\\r\\nthat the young couple did not use hackney-coaches in times prior to the\\r\\nintroduction of those serviceable vehicles, and that until sedans were\\r\\ninvented my lady never used them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible, indeed it is certain, that married ladies living in\\r\\nchambers occasionally had for neighbors on the same staircase women whom\\r\\nthey regarded with abhorrence. Sometimes it happened that a dissolute\\r\\nbarrister introduced to his rooms a woman more beautiful than virtuous,\\r\\nwhom he had not married, though he called her his wife. People can no\\r\\nmore choose their neighbors in a house broken up into sets of chambers,\\r\\nthan they can choose them in the street. But the cases where ladies\\r\\nwere daily liable to meet an offensive neighbor on their common\\r\\nstaircase were comparatively rare; and when the annoyance actually\\r\\noccurred, the discipline of the Inn afforded a remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncleanness too often lurked within the camp, but it veiled its face;\\r\\nand though in rare cases the error and sin of a powerful lawyer may have\\r\\nbeen notorious, the preccant man was careful to surround himself with\\r\\nsuch an appearance of respectability that society should easily feign\\r\\nignorance of his offence. An Elizabethan distich--familiar to all\\r\\nbarristers, but too rudely worded for insertion in this page--informs us\\r\\nthat in the sixteenth century Gray\\'s Inn had an unenviable notoriety\\r\\namongst legal hospices for the shamelessness of its female inmates. But\\r\\nthe pungent lines must be regarded as a satire aimed at certain\\r\\nexceptional members, rather than as a vivacious picture of the general\\r\\ntone of morals in the society. Anyhow the fact that Gray\\'s Inn[1] was\\r\\nalone designated as a home for infamy--whilst the Inner Temple was\\r\\npointed to as the hospice most popular with rich men, the Middle Temple\\r\\nas the society frequented by Templars of narrow means, and Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\nas the abode of gentlemen--is, of itself, a proof that the pervading\\r\\nmanners of the last three institutions were outwardly decorous. Under\\r\\nthe least favorable circumstances, a barrister\\'s wife living in\\r\\nchambers, within or near Lincoln\\'s Inn, or the Temple, during Charles\\r\\nII.\\'s reign, fared as well in this respect as she would have done had\\r\\nFortune made her a lady-in-waiting at Whitehall.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good story is told of certain visits paid to William Murray\\'s chambers\\r\\nat No. 5, King\\'s Bench Walk Temple, in the year 1738. Born in 1705,\\r\\nMurray was still a young man when in 1738 he made his brilliant speech\\r\\nin behalf of Colonel Sloper, against whom Colley Cibber\\'s rascally son\\r\\nhad brought an action for _crim. con._ with his wife--the lovely actress\\r\\nwho was the rival of Mrs. Clive. Amongst the many clients who were drawn\\r\\nto Murray by that speech, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, was neither the\\r\\nleast powerful nor the least distinguished. Her grace began by sending\\r\\nthe rising advocate a general retainer, with a fee of a thousand\\r\\nguineas; of which sum he accepted only the two-hundredth part,\\r\\nexplaining to the astonished duchess that \"the professional fee, with a\\r\\ngeneral retainer, could neither be less nor more than five guineas.\" If\\r\\nMurray had accepted the whole sum he would not have been overpaid for\\r\\nhis trouble; for her grace persecuted him with calls at most\\r\\nunseasonable hours. On one occasion, returning to his chambers after\\r\\n\"drinking champagne with the wits,\" he found the duchess\\'s carriage and\\r\\nattendants on King\\'s Bench Walk. A numerous crowd of footmen and\\r\\nlink-bearers surrounded the coach; and when the barrister entered his\\r\\nchambers he encountered the mistress of that army of lackeys. \"Young\\r\\nman,\" exclaimed the grand lady, eying the future Lord Mansfield with a\\r\\nlook of warm displeasure, \"if you mean to rise in the world, you must\\r\\nnot sup out.\" On a subsequent night Sarah of Marlborough called without\\r\\nappointment at the same chambers, and waited till past midnight in the\\r\\nhope that she would see the lawyer ere she went to bed. But Murray being\\r\\nat an unusually late supper-party, did not return till her grace had\\r\\ndeparted in an over-powering rage. \"I could not make out, sir, who she\\r\\nwas,\" said Murray\\'s clerk, describing her grace\\'s appearance and manner,\\r\\n\"for she would not tell me her name; _but she swore so dreadfully that I\\r\\nam sure she must be a lady of quality_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the Inns of Court may still shelter a few married ladies, who\\r\\neither from love of old-world ways, or from stern necessity, consent to\\r\\ndwell in their husbands\\' chambers. If such ladies can at the present\\r\\ntime be found, the writer of this page would look for them in Gray\\'s\\r\\nInn--that straggling caravansary for the reception of money-lenders,\\r\\nBohemians, and eccentric gentlemen--rather than in the other three Inns\\r\\nof Court, which have undoubtedly quite lost their old population of\\r\\nlady-residents. But from those three hospices the last of the ladies\\r\\nmust have retreated at a comparatively recent date. Fifteen years since,\\r\\nwhen the writer of this book was a beardless undergraduate, he had the\\r\\nhonor of knowing some married ladies, of good family and unblemished\\r\\nrepute, who lived with their husbands in the Middle Temple. One of those\\r\\nladies--the daughter of a country magistrate, the sister of a\\r\\ndistinguished classic scholar--was the wife of a common law barrister\\r\\nwho now holds a judicial appointment in one of our colonies. The women\\r\\nof her old home circle occasionally called on this young wife: but as\\r\\nthey could not reach her quarters in Sycamore Court without attracting\\r\\nmuch unpleasant observation, their visits were not frequent. Living in a\\r\\nbarrack of unwed men, that charming girl was surrounded by honest\\r\\nfellows who would have resented as an insult to themselves an\\r\\nimpertinence offered to her. Still her life was abnormal, unnatural,\\r\\ndeleterious; it was felt by all who cared for her that she ought not to\\r\\nbe where she was; and when an appointment with a good income in a\\r\\nhealthy and thriving colony was offered to her husband, all who knew\\r\\nher, and many who had never spoken to her, rejoiced at the intelligence.\\r\\nAt the present time, in the far distant country which looks up to her\\r\\nas a personage of importance, this lady--not less exemplary as wife and\\r\\nmother than brilliant as a woman of society--takes pleasure in recalling\\r\\nthe days when she was a prisoner in the Temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the last cases of married life in the Temple, that came before\\r\\nthe public notice, was that of a barrister and his wife who incurred\\r\\nobloquy and punishment for their brutal conduct to a poor servant girl.\\r\\nNo one would thank the writer for re-publishing the details of that\\r\\nnauseous illustration of the degradation to which it is possible for a\\r\\ngentleman and scholar to sink. But, however revolting, the case is not\\r\\nwithout interest for the reader who is curious about the social life of\\r\\nthe Temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe portion of the Temple in which the old-world family life of the Inns\\r\\nheld out the longest, is a clump of commodious houses lying between the\\r\\nMiddle Temple Garden and Essex Street, Strand. Having their\\r\\nentrance-doors in Essex Street, these houses are, in fact, as private as\\r\\nthe residences of any London quarter. The noise of the Strand reaches\\r\\nthem, but their occupants are as secure from the impertinent gaze or\\r\\nunwelcome familiarities of law-students and barristers\\' clerks, as they\\r\\nwould be if they lived at St. John\\'s Wood. In Essex Street, on the\\r\\neastern side, the legal families maintained their ground almost till\\r\\nyesterday. Fifteen years since the writer of this page used to be\\r\\ninvited to dinners and dances in that street--dinners and dances which\\r\\nwere attended by prosperous gentlefolk from the West End of the town. At\\r\\nthat time he often waltzed in a drawing-room, the windows of which\\r\\nlooked upon the spray of the fountain--at which Ruth Pinch loved to gaze\\r\\nwhen its jet resembled a wagoner\\'s whip. How all old and precious things\\r\\npass away! The dear old \\'wagoner\\'s whip\\' has been replaced by a pert,\\r\\nperky squirt that will never stir the heart or brain of a future Ruth.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] The scandalous state of Gray\\'s Inn at this period is shown by the\\r\\nfollowing passage in Dugdale\\'s \\'Origines:\\'--\"In 23 Eliz. (30 Jan.) there\\r\\nwas an order made that no laundress, nor women called victuallers,\\r\\nshould thenceforth come into the gentlemen\\'s chambers of this society,\\r\\nuntil they were full forty years of age, and not send their\\r\\nmaid-servants, of what age soever, in the said gentlemen\\'s chambers,\\r\\nupon penalty, for the first offence of him that should admit of any\\r\\nsuch, to be put out of Commons: and for the second, to be expelled the\\r\\nHouse.\" The stringency and severity of this order show a determination\\r\\non the part of the authorities to cure the evil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter III.\\r\\n\\r\\nYORK HOUSE AND POWIS HOUSE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the great body of lawyers dwelt in or hard by the Inns, the\\r\\ndignitaries of the judicial bench, and the more eminent members of the\\r\\nbar, had suitable palaces or mansions at greater or less distances from\\r\\nthe legal hostelries. The ecclesiastical Chancellors usually enjoyed\\r\\nepiscopal or archiepiscopal rank, and lived in the London palaces\\r\\nattached to their sees or provinces. During his tenure of the seals,\\r\\nMorton, Bishop of Ely, years before he succeeded to the archbishopric of\\r\\nCanterbury, and received the honors of the Cardinalate, grew\\r\\nstrawberries in his garden on Holborn Hill, and lived in the palace\\r\\nsurrounded by that garden. As Archbishop of Canterbury, Chancellor\\r\\nWarham maintained at Lambeth Palace the imposing state commemorated by\\r\\nErasmus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Wolsey made his first progress to the Court of Chancery in\\r\\nWestminster Hall, a progress already alluded to in these pages, he\\r\\nstarted from the archiepiscopal palace, York House or Place--an official\\r\\nresidence sold by the cardinal to Henry VIII. some years later; and when\\r\\nthe same superb ecclesiastic, towards the close of his career, went on\\r\\nthe memorable embassy to France, he set out from his palace at\\r\\nWestminster, \"passing through all London over London Bridge, having\\r\\nbefore him of gentlemen a great number, three in rank in black velvet\\r\\nlivery coats, and the most of them with great chains of gold about their\\r\\nnecks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt later dates Gardyner, whilst he held the seals, kept his numerous\\r\\nhousehold at Winchester House in Southwark; and Williams, the last\\r\\nclerical Lord Keeper, lived at the Deanery, Westminster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lay Chancellors also maintained costly and pompous establishments,\\r\\napart from the Inns of Court. Sir Thomas More\\'s house stood in the\\r\\ncountry, flanked by a garden and farm, in the cultivation of which\\r\\nground the Chancellor found one of his chief sources of amusement. In\\r\\nAldgate, Lord Chancellor Audley built his town mansion, on the site of\\r\\nthe Priory of the Canons of the Holy Trinity of Christ Church.\\r\\nWriothesley dwelt in Holborn at the height of his unsteady fortunes, and\\r\\nat the time of his death. The infamous but singularly lucky Rich lived\\r\\nin Great St. Bartholomew\\'s, and from his mansion there wrote to the Duke\\r\\nof Northumberland, imploring that messengers might be sent to him to\\r\\nrelieve him of the perilous trust of the Great Seal. Christopher Hatton\\r\\nwrested from the see of Ely the site of Holborn, whereon he built his\\r\\nmagnificent palace. The reluctance with which the Bishop of Ely\\r\\nsurrendered the ground, and the imperious letter by which Elizabeth\\r\\ncompelled the prelate to comply with the wish of her favorite courtier,\\r\\nform one of the humorous episodes of that queen\\'s reign. Hatton House\\r\\nrose over the soil which had yielded strawberries to Morton; and of that\\r\\nhouse--where the dancing Chancellor received Elizabeth as a visitor, and\\r\\nin which he died of \"diabetes _and_ grief of mind\"--the memory is\\r\\npreserved by Hatton Garden, the name of the street where some of our\\r\\nwealthiest jewelers and gold assayers have places of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic convenience had long suggested the expediency of establishing a\\r\\npermanent residence for the Chancellors of England, when either by\\r\\nsuccessive expressions of the royal will, or by the individual choice of\\r\\nseveral successive holders of the _Clavis Regni_, a noble palace on the\\r\\nnorthern bank of the Thames came to be regarded as the proper domicile\\r\\nfor the Great Seal. York House, memorable as the birthplace of Francis\\r\\nBacon, and the scene of his brightest social splendor, demands a brief\\r\\nnotice. Wolsey\\'s \\'York House\\' or Whitehall having passed from the\\r\\nprovince of York to the crown, Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of York,\\r\\nestablished himself in another York House on a site lying between the\\r\\nStrand and the river. In this palace (formerly leased to the see of\\r\\nNorwich as a bishop\\'s Inn, and subsequently conferred on Charles Brandon\\r\\nby Henry VIII.) Heath resided during his Chancellorship; and when, in\\r\\nconsequence of his refusal to take the oath of supremacy, Elizabeth\\r\\ndeprived him of his archbishopric, York House passed into the hands of\\r\\nher new Lord Keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon. On succeeding to the honors of\\r\\nthe Marble Chair, Hatton did not move from Holborn to the Strand; but\\r\\notherwise all the holders of the Great Seal, from Heath to Francis Bacon\\r\\ninclusive, seem to have occupied York House; Heath, of course, using it\\r\\nby right as Archbishop of York, and the others holding it under leases\\r\\ngranted by successive archbishops of the northern province. So little is\\r\\nknown of Bromley, apart from the course which he took towards Mary of\\r\\nScotland, that the memory of old York House gains nothing of interest\\r\\nfrom him. Indeed it has been questioned whether he was one of its\\r\\ntenants. Puckering, Egerton, and Francis Bacon certainly inhabited it in\\r\\nsuccession. On Bacon\\'s fall it was granted to Buckingham, whose desire\\r\\nto possess the picturesque palace was one of the motives which impelled\\r\\nhim to blacken the great lawyer\\'s reputation. Seized by the Long\\r\\nParliament, it was granted to Lord Fairfax. In the following generation\\r\\nit passed into the hands of the second Duke of Buckingham, who sold\\r\\nhouse and precinct for building-ground. The bad memory of the man who\\r\\nthus for gold surrendered a spot of earth sacred to every scholarly\\r\\nEnglishman is preserved in the names of _George_ Street, _Duke_ Street,\\r\\n_Villiers_ Street, _Buckingham_ Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engravings commonly sold as pictures of the York House, in which\\r\\nLord Bacon kept the seals, are likenesses of the building after it was\\r\\npulled about, diminished, and modernized, and in no way whatever\\r\\nrepresent the architecture of the original edifice. Amongst the\\r\\nart-treasures of the University of Oxford, Mr. Hepworth Dixon\\r\\nfortunately found a rough sketch of the real house, from which sketch\\r\\nMr. E.M. Ward drew the vignette that embellishes the title-page of \\'The\\r\\nStory of Lord Bacon\\'s Life.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the expulsion of the Great Seal from old York House, it wandered\\r\\nfrom house to house, manifesting, however, in its selections of London\\r\\nquarters, a preference for the grand line of thoroughfare between\\r\\nCharing Cross and the foot of Ludgate Hill. Escaping from the\\r\\nWestminster Deanery, where Williams kept it in a box, the _Clavis Regni_\\r\\ninhabited Durham House, Strand, whilst under Lord Keeper Coventry\\'s\\r\\ncare. Lord Keeper Littleton, until he made his famous ride from London\\r\\nto York, lived in Exeter House. Clarendon resided in Dorset House,\\r\\nSalisbury Court, Fleet Street, and subsequently in Worcester House,\\r\\nStrand, before he removed to the magnificent palace which aroused the\\r\\nindignation of the public in St. James\\'s Street. The greater and happier\\r\\npart of his official life was passed in Worcester House. There he held\\r\\ncouncils in his bedroom when he was laid up with gout; there King\\r\\nCharles visited him familiarly, even condescending to be present to the\\r\\nbedside councils; and there he was established when the Great Fire of\\r\\nLondon caused him, in a panic, to send his most valuable furniture to\\r\\nhis Villa at Twickenham. Thanet House, Aldersgate Street, is the\\r\\nresidence with which Shaftesbury, the politician, is most generally\\r\\nassociated; but whilst he was Lord Chancellor he occupied Exeter House,\\r\\nStrand, formerly the abode of Keeper Littleton. Lord Nottingham slept\\r\\nwith the seals under his pillow in Great Queen Street, Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\nFields, the same street in which his successor, Lord Guildford, had the\\r\\nestablishment so racily described by his brother, Roger North. And Lord\\r\\nJeffreys moving westward, gave noisy dinners in Duke Street,\\r\\nWestminster, where he opened a court-house that was afterwards\\r\\nconsecrated as a place of worship, and is still known as the Duke Street\\r\\nChapel. Says Pennant, describing the Chancellor\\'s residence, \"It is\\r\\neasily known by a large flight of stone steps, which his royal master\\r\\npermitted to be made into the park adjacent for the accommodation of his\\r\\nlordship. These steps terminate above in a small court, on three sides\\r\\nof which stands the house.\" The steps still remain, but their history is\\r\\nunknown to many of the habitual frequenters of the chapel. After\\r\\nJefferys\\' fall the spacious and imposing mansion, where the\\r\\n_bon-vivants_ of the bar used to drink inordinately with the wits and\\r\\nbuffoons of the London theatres, was occupied by Government; and there\\r\\nthe Lords of the Admiralty had their offices until they moved to their\\r\\nquarters opposite Scotland Yard. Narcissus Luttrell\\'s Diary contains the\\r\\nfollowing entry:--\"April 23, 1690. The late Lord Chancellor\\'s house at\\r\\nWestminster is taken for the Lords of the Admiralty to keep the\\r\\nAdmiralty Office at.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam III., wishing to fix the holders of the Great Seal in a\\r\\npermanent official home, selected Powis House (more generally known by\\r\\nthe name of Newcastle House), in Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, as a residence\\r\\nfor Somers and future Chancellors. The Treasury minute books preserve an\\r\\nentry of September 11, 1696, directing a Privy Seal to \"discharge the\\r\\nprocess for the apprised value of the house, and to declare the king\\'s\\r\\npleasure that the Lord Keeper or Lord Chancellor for the time being\\r\\nshould have and enjoy it for the accommodation of their offices.\" Soon\\r\\nafter his appointment to the seals, Somers took possession of this\\r\\nmansion at the north-west corner of the Fields; and after him Lord\\r\\nKeeper Sir Nathan Wright, Lord Chancellor Cowper, and Lord Chancellor\\r\\nHarcourt used it as an official residence. But the arrangement was not\\r\\nacceptable to the legal dignitaries. They preferred to dwell in their\\r\\nprivate houses, from which they were not liable to be driven by a change\\r\\nof ministry or a grist of popular disfavor. In the year 1711 the mansion\\r\\nwas therefore sold to John Holles, Duke of Newcastle, to whom it is\\r\\nindebted for the name which it still bears. This large, unsightly\\r\\nmansion is known to every one who lives in London, and has any knowledge\\r\\nof the political and social life of the earlier Georgian courtiers and\\r\\nstatesmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\n\\r\\nLINCOLN\\'S INN FIELDS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe annals of the legal profession show that the neighborhood of\\r\\nGuildhall was a favorite place of residence with the ancient lawyers,\\r\\nwho either held judicial offices within the circle of the Lord Mayor\\'s\\r\\njurisdiction, or whose practice lay chiefly in the civic courts. In the\\r\\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries there was quite a colony of jurists\\r\\nhard by the temple of Gogmagog and Cosineus--or Gog and Magog, as the\\r\\ngrotesque giants are designated by the unlearned, who know not the\\r\\nhistory of the two famous effigies, which originally figured in an\\r\\nElizabethan pageant, stirring the wonder of the illiterate, and\\r\\nreminding scholars of two mythical heroes about whom the curious reader\\r\\nof this paragraph may learn further particulars by referring to Michael\\r\\nDrayton\\'s \\'Polyolbion.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Milk Street, Cheapside, lived Sir John More, judge in the Court of\\r\\nKing\\'s Bench; and in Milk street, A.D. 1480, was born Sir John\\'s famous\\r\\nson Thomas, the Chancellor, who was at the same time learned and simple,\\r\\nwitty and pious, notable for gentle meekness and firm resolve, abounding\\r\\nwith tenderness and hot with courage. Richard Rich--who beyond Scroggs\\r\\nor Jeffreys deserves to be remembered as the arch-scoundrel of the legal\\r\\nprofession--was one of Thomas More\\'s playmates and boon companions for\\r\\nseveral years of their boyhood and youth. Richard\\'s father was an\\r\\nopulent mercer, and one of Sir John\\'s near neighbors; so the youngsters\\r\\nwere intimate until Master Dick, exhibiting at an early age his vicious\\r\\npropensities, came to be \"esteemed very light of his tongue, a great\\r\\ndicer and gamester, and not of any commendable fame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn marrying his first wife Sir Thomas More settled in a house in\\r\\nBucklersbury, the City being the proper quarter for his residence, as he\\r\\nwas an under-sheriff of the city of London, in which character he both\\r\\nsat in the Court of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and presided over a\\r\\nseparate court on the Thursday of each week. Whilst living in\\r\\nBucklersbury he had chambers in Lincoln\\'s Inn. On leaving Bucklersbury\\r\\nhe took a house in Crosby Place, from which he moved, in 1523, to\\r\\nChelsea, in which parish he built the house that was eventually pulled\\r\\ndown by Sir Hans Sloane in the year 1740.\\r\\n\\r\\nA generation later, Sir Nicholas Bacon was living in Noble Street,\\r\\nFoster Lane, where he had built the mansion known as Bacon House, in\\r\\nwhich he resided till, as Lord Keeper, he took possession of York House.\\r\\nChief Justice Bramston lived, at different parts of his career, in\\r\\nWhitechapel; in Philip Lane, Aldermanbury; and (after his removal from\\r\\nBosworth Court) in Warwick Lane, Sir John Bramston (the autobiographer)\\r\\nmarried into a house in Charterhouse Yard, where his father, the Chief\\r\\nJustice, resided with him for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut from an early date, and especially during the seventeenth and\\r\\neighteenth centuries, the more prosperous of the working lawyers either\\r\\nlived within the walls of the Inns, or in houses lying near the law\\r\\ncolleges. Fleet Street, the Strand, Holborn, Chancery Lane, and the good\\r\\nstreets leading into those thoroughfares, contained a numerous legal\\r\\npopulation in the times between Elizabeth\\'s death and George III.\\'s\\r\\nfirst illness. Rich benchers and Judges wishing for more commodious\\r\\nquarters than they could obtain at any cost within college-walls,\\r\\nerected mansions in the immediate vicinity of their Inns; and their\\r\\nexample was followed by less exalted and less opulent members of the bar\\r\\nand judicial bench. The great Lord Strafford first saw the light in\\r\\nChancery Lane, in the house of his maternal grandfather, who was a\\r\\nbencher of Lincoln\\'s Inn. Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields was principally built for\\r\\nthe accommodation of wealthy lawyers; and in Charles II.\\'s reign Queen\\r\\nStreet, Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields was in high repute with legal magnates. Sir\\r\\nEdward Coke lived alternately in chambers, and in Hatton House, Holborn,\\r\\nthe palace that came to him by his second marriage. John Kelyng\\'s house\\r\\nstood in Hatton Garden, and there he died in 1671. In his mansion in\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields, Sir Harbottle Grimston, on June 25, 1660 (shortly\\r\\nbefore his appointment to the Mastership of the Rolls, for which place\\r\\nhe is said to have given Clarendon £8000), entertained Charles II. and a\\r\\ngrand gathering of noble company. After his marriage Francis North took\\r\\nhis high-born bride into chambers, which they inhabited for a short time\\r\\nuntil a house in Chancery Lane, near Serjeants\\' Inn, was ready for\\r\\ntheir use. On Nov. 15, 1666,--the year of the fire of London, in which\\r\\nyear Hyde had his town house in the Strand--Glyn died in his house, in\\r\\nPortugal Row, Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields. On June 15, 1691, Henry Pollexfen,\\r\\nChief Justice of Common Pleas, expired in his mansion in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\nFields. These addresses--taken from a list of legal addresses lying\\r\\nbefore the writer--indicate with sufficient clearness the quarter of the\\r\\ntown in which Charles II.\\'s lawyers mostly resided.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Charles II. the population of the Inns was such that barristers\\r\\nwishing to marry could not easily obtain commodious quarters within\\r\\nCollege-walls. Dugdale observes \"that all but the benchers go two to a\\r\\nchamber: a bencher hath only the privilege of a chamber to himself.\" He\\r\\nadds--\"if there be any one chamber consisting of two parts, and the one\\r\\npart exceeds the other in value, and he who hath the best part sells the\\r\\nsame, yet the purchaser shall enter into the worst part; for it is a\\r\\ncertain rule that the auntient in the chamber--_viz._, he who was\\r\\ntherein first admitted, without respect to their antiquity in the house,\\r\\nhath his choice of either part.\" This custom of sharing chambers gave\\r\\nrise to the word \\'chumming,\\' an abbreviation of \\'chambering.\\' Barristers\\r\\nin the present time often share a chamber--_i.e._, set of rooms. In the\\r\\nseventeenth century an utter-barrister found the half of a set of rooms\\r\\ninconveniently narrow quarters for himself and wife. By arranging\\r\\nprivately with a non-resident brother of the long robe, he sometimes\\r\\nobtained an entire \"chamber,\" and had the space allotted to a bencher.\\r\\nWhen he could not make such an arrangement, he usually moved to a house\\r\\noutside the gate, but in the immediate vicinity of his inn, as soon as\\r\\nhis lady presented him with children, if not sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course working, as well as idle, members of the profession were found\\r\\nin other quarters. Some still lived in the City; others preferred more\\r\\nfashionable districts. Roger North, brother of the Lord Keeper and son\\r\\nof a peer, lived in the Piazza of Covent Garden, in the house formerly\\r\\noccupied Lely the painter. To this house Sir Dudley North moved from his\\r\\ncostly and dark mansion in the City, and in it he shortly afterwards\\r\\ndied, under the hands of Dr. Radcliffe and the prosperous apothecary,\\r\\nMr. St. Amand. \"He had removed,\" writes Roger, \"from his great house in\\r\\nthe City, and came to that in the Piazza which Sir Peter Lely formerly\\r\\nused, and I had lived in alone for divers years. We were so much\\r\\ntogether, and my incumbrances so small, that so large a house might hold\\r\\nus both.\" Roger was a practicing barrister and Recorder of Bristol.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his latter years Sir John Bramston (the autobiographer) kept\\r\\nhouse in Greek Street, Soho.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the time of Charles II. the wealthy lawyers often maintained suburban\\r\\nvillas, where they enjoyed the air and pastimes of the country. When his\\r\\nwife\\'s health failed, Francis North took a villa for her at Hammersmith,\\r\\n\"for the advantage of better air, which he thought beneficial for her;\"\\r\\nand whilst his household tarried there, he never slept at his chambers\\r\\nin town, \"but always went home to his family, and was seldom an evening\\r\\nwithout company agreeable to him.\" In his latter years, Chief Justice\\r\\nPemberton had a rural mansion in Highgate, where his death occurred on\\r\\nJune 10, 1699, in the 74th year of his age. A pleasant chapter might be\\r\\nwritten on the suburban seats of our great lawyers from the Restoration\\r\\ndown to the present time. Lord Mansfield\\'s \\'Kenwood\\' is dear to all who\\r\\nare curious in legal _ana_. Charles Yorke had a villa at Highgate, where\\r\\nhe entertained his political and personal friends. Holland, the\\r\\narchitect, built a villa at Dulwich for Lord Thurlow; and in consequence\\r\\nof a quarrel between the Chancellor and the builder, the former took\\r\\nsuch a dislike to the house, that after its completion he never slept a\\r\\nnight in it, though he often passed his holidays in a small lodge\\r\\nstanding in the grounds of the villa. \"Lord Thurlow,\" asked a lady of\\r\\nhim, as he was leaving the Queen\\'s Drawing-room, \"when are you going\\r\\ninto your new house?\" \"Madam,\" answered the surly Chancellor, incensed\\r\\nby her curiosity, \"the Queen has asked me that impudent question, and I\\r\\nwould not answer her; I will not tell you.\" For years Loughborough and\\r\\nErskine had houses in Hampstead. \"In Lord Mansfield\\'s time,\" Erskine\\r\\nonce said to Lord Campbell, \"although the King\\'s Bench monopolized all\\r\\nthe common-law business, the court often rose at one or two o\\'clock--the\\r\\npapers, special, crown, and peremptory, being cleared; and then I\\r\\nrefreshed myself by a drive to my villa at Hampstead.\" It was on\\r\\nHampstead Heath that Loughborough, meeting Erskine in the dusk, said,\\r\\n\"Erskine, you must not take Paine\\'s brief;\" and received the prompt\\r\\nreply, \"But I have been retained, and I will take it, by G-d!\" Much of\\r\\nthat which is most pleasant in Erskine\\'s career occurred at his\\r\\nHampstead villa. Of Lord Kenyon\\'s weekly trips from his mansion in\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields to his farm-house at Richmond notice has been taken\\r\\nin a previous chapter. The memory of Charles Abbott\\'s Hendon villa is\\r\\npreserved in the name, style, and title of Lord Tenterden, of Hendon, in\\r\\nthe county of Middlesex. Indeed, lawyers have for many generations\\r\\nmanifested much fondness for fresh air; the impure atmosphere of their\\r\\ncourts in past time apparently whetting their appetites for wholesome\\r\\nbreezes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the eighteenth century Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, an open though\\r\\ndisorderly spot, was a great place for the residence of legal magnates.\\r\\nSomers, Nathan Wright, Cowper, Harcourt, successively inhabited Powis\\r\\nHouse. Chief Justice Parker (subsequently Lord Chancellor Macclesfield)\\r\\nlived there when he engaged Philip Yorke (then an attorney\\'s articled\\r\\nclerk, but afterwards Lord Chancellor of England) to be his son\\'s law\\r\\ntutor. On the south side of the square, Lord Chancellor Henley kept high\\r\\nstate in the family mansion that descended to him on the death of his\\r\\nelder brother, and subsequently passed into the hands of the Surgeons,\\r\\nwhose modest but convenient college stands upon its site. Wedderburn and\\r\\nErskine had their mansions in Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, as well as their\\r\\nsuburban villas. And between the lawyers of the Restoration and the\\r\\njudges of George III.\\'s reign, a large proportion of our most eminent\\r\\njurists and advocates lived in that square and the adjoining streets;\\r\\nsuch as Queen Street on the west, Serle Street, Carey Street, Portugal\\r\\nStreet, Chancery Lane, on the south and south-east. The reader, let it\\r\\nbe observed, may not infer that this quarter was confined to legal\\r\\nresidents. The lawyers were the most conspicuous and influential\\r\\noccupants; but they had for neighbors people of higher quality, who,\\r\\nattracted to the square by its openness, or the convenience of its site,\\r\\nor the proximity of the law colleges, made it their place of abode in\\r\\nLondon. Such names as those of the Earl of Lindsey and the Earl of\\r\\nSandwich in the seventeenth, and of the Duke of Ancaster and the Duke of\\r\\nNewcastle in the eighteenth century, establish the patrician character\\r\\nof the quarter for many years. Moreover, from the books of popular\\r\\nantiquaries, a long list might be made of wits, men of science, and\\r\\nminor celebrities, who, though in no way personally connected with the\\r\\nlaw, lived during the same period under the shadow of Lincoln\\'s Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields took rank amongst the most aristocratic\\r\\nquarters of the town, it was as disorderly a square as could be found in\\r\\nall London. Royal suggestions, the labors of a learned committee\\r\\nespecially appointed by James I. to decide on a proper system of\\r\\narchitecture, and Inigo Jones\\'s magnificent but abortive scheme had but\\r\\na poor result. In Queen Anne\\'s reign, and for twenty years later, the\\r\\nopen space of the fields was daily crowded with beggars, mountebanks,\\r\\nand noisy rabble; and it was the scene of constant uproar and frequent\\r\\nriots. As soon as a nobleman\\'s coach drew up before one of the\\r\\nsurrounding mansions, a mob of half-naked rascals swarmed about the\\r\\nequipage, asking for alms in alternate tones of entreaty and menace.\\r\\nPugilistic encounters, and fights resembling the faction fights of an\\r\\nIrish row, were of daily occurrence there; and when the rabble decided\\r\\non torturing a bull with dogs, the wretched beast was tied to a stake in\\r\\nthe centre of the wide area, and there baited in the presence of a\\r\\nferocious multitude, and to the diversion of fashionable ladies, who\\r\\nwatched the scene from their drawing-room windows. The Sacheverell\\r\\noutrage was wildest in this chosen quarter of noblemen and blackguards;\\r\\nand in George II.\\'s reign, when Sir Joseph Jekyll, the Master of the\\r\\nRolls, made himself odious to the lowest class by his Act for laying an\\r\\nexcise upon gin, a mob assailed him in the middle of the fields, threw\\r\\nhim to the ground, kicked him over and over, and savagely trampled upon\\r\\nhim. It was a marvel that he escaped with his life; but with\\r\\ncharacteristic good humor, he soon made a joke of his ill-usage, saying\\r\\nthat until the mob made him their football he had never been master of\\r\\n_all_ the _rolls_. Soon after this outbreak of popular violence, the\\r\\ninhabitants enclosed the middle of the area with palisades, and turned\\r\\nthe enclosure into an ornamental garden. Describing the Fields in 1736,\\r\\nthe year in which the obnoxious Act concerning gin became law, James\\r\\nRalph says, \"Several of the original houses still remain, to be a\\r\\nreproach to the rest; and I wish the disadvantageous comparison had\\r\\nbeen a warning to others to have avoided a like mistake.... But this is\\r\\nnot the only quarrel I have to Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields. The area is capable\\r\\nof the highest improvement, might be made a credit to the whole city,\\r\\nand do honor to those who live round it; whereas at present no place can\\r\\nbe more contemptible or forbidding; in short, it serves only as a\\r\\nnursery for beggars and thieves, and is a daily reflection on those who\\r\\nsuffer it to be in its abandoned condition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the eighteenth century, a tendency to establish themselves in the\\r\\nwestern portion of the town was discernible amongst the great law lords.\\r\\nFor instance, Lord Cowper, who during his tenure of the seals resided in\\r\\nPowis House, during his latter years occupied a mansion in Great George\\r\\nStreet, Westminster--once a most fashionable locality, but now a street\\r\\nalmost entirely given up to civil engineers, who have offices there, but\\r\\nusually live elsewhere. In like manner, Lord Harcourt, moving westwards\\r\\nfrom Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, established himself in Cavendish Square. Lord\\r\\nHenley, on retiring from the family mansion in Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields,\\r\\nsettled in Grosvenor Square. Lord Camden lived in Hill Street, Berkeley\\r\\nSquare. On being entrusted with the sole custody of the seals, Lord\\r\\nApsley (better known as Lord Chancellor Bathurst) made his first\\r\\nstate-progress to Westminster Hall from his house in Dean Street, Soho;\\r\\nbut afterwards moving farther west, he built Apsley House (familiar to\\r\\nevery Englishman as the late Duke of Wellington\\'s town mansion) upon the\\r\\nsite of Squire Western\\'s favorite inn--the \\'Hercules\\' Pillars.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OLD LAW QUARTER.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen years since the writer of this page used to dine with a\\r\\nconveyancer--a lawyer of an old and almost obsolete school--who had a\\r\\nnumerous household, and kept a hospitable table in Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields;\\r\\nbut the conveyancer was almost the last of his species. The householding\\r\\nlegal _resident_ of the Fields, like the domestic resident of the\\r\\nTemple, has become a feature of the past. Among the ordinary nocturnal\\r\\npopulation of the square called Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, may be found a few\\r\\nsolicitors who sleep by night where they work by day, and a sprinkling\\r\\nof young barristers and law students who have residential chambers in\\r\\ngrand houses that less than a century since were tenanted by members of\\r\\na proud and splendid aristocracy; but the gentle families have by this\\r\\ntime altogether disappeared from the mansions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut long before this aristocratic secession, the lawyers took possession\\r\\nof a new quarter. The great charm of Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields had been the\\r\\nfreshness of the air which played over the open space. So also the\\r\\nrecommendation of Great Queen Street had been the purity of its rural\\r\\natmosphere. Built between 1630 and 1730, that thoroughfare--at present\\r\\nhemmed in by fetid courts and narrow passages--caught the keen breezes\\r\\nof Hampstead, and long maintained a character for salubrity as well as\\r\\nfashion. Of those fine squares and imposing streets which lie between\\r\\nHigh Holborn and Hampstead, not a stone had been laid when the ground\\r\\ncovered by the present Freemason\\'s Tavern was one of the most desirable\\r\\nsites of the metropolis. Indeed, the houses between Holborn and Great\\r\\nQueen Street were not erected till the mansions on the south side of\\r\\nthe latter thoroughfare--built long before the northern side--had for\\r\\nyears commanded an unbroken view of Holborn Fields. Notwithstanding many\\r\\ngloomy predictions of the evils that would necessarily follow from\\r\\nover-building, London steadily increased, and enterprising architects\\r\\ndeprived Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields and Great Queen Street of their rural\\r\\nqualities. Crossing Holborn, the lawyers settled on a virgin plain\\r\\nbeyond the ugly houses which had sprung up on the north of Great Queen\\r\\nStreet, and on the country side of Holborn. Speedily a new quarter\\r\\narose, extending from Gray\\'s Inn on the east to Southampton Row on the\\r\\nWest, and lying between Holborn and the line of Ormond Street, Red Lion\\r\\nStreet, Bedford Row, Great Ormond Street, Little Ormond Street, Great\\r\\nJames Street, and Little James Street were amongst its best\\r\\nthoroughfares; in its centre was Red Lion Square, and in its\\r\\nnorthwestern corner lay Queen\\'s Square. Steadily enlarging its\\r\\nboundaries, it comprised at later dates Guildford Street, John\\'s Street,\\r\\nDoughty Street, Mecklenburgh Square, Brunswick Square, Bloomsbury\\r\\nSquare, Russell Square, Bedford Square--indeed, all the region lying\\r\\nbetween Gray\\'s Inn Lane (on the east), Tottenham Court Road (on the\\r\\nwest), Holborn (on the south), and a line running along the north of the\\r\\nFoundling Hospital and \\'the squares.\\' Of course this large residential\\r\\ndistrict was more than the lawyers required for themselves. It became\\r\\nand long remained a favorite quarter with merchants, physicians,[2] and\\r\\nsurgeons; and until a recent date it comprised the mansions of many\\r\\nleading members of the aristocracy. But from its first commencement it\\r\\nwas so intimately associated with the legal profession that it was often\\r\\ncalled the \\'law quarter;\\' and the writer of this page has often heard\\r\\nelderly ladies and gentlemen speak of it as the \\'old law quarter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough lawyers were the earliest householders in this new quarter, its\\r\\nchief architect encountered at first strong opposition from a section of\\r\\nthe legal profession. Anxious to preserve the rural character of their\\r\\nneighborhood, the gentlemen of Gray\\'s Inn were greatly displeased with\\r\\nthe proposal to lay out Holborn Fields in streets and squares. Under\\r\\ndate June 10, 1684, Narcissus Luttrell wrote in his diary--\"Dr.\\r\\nBarebone, the great builder, having some time since bought the Red Lyon\\r\\nFields, near Graie\\'s Inn walks, to build on, and having for that purpose\\r\\nemployed severall workmen to goe on with the same, the gentlemen of\\r\\nGraie\\'s Inn took notice of it, and, thinking it an injury to them, went\\r\\nwith a considerable body of 100 persons; upon which the workmen\\r\\nassaulted the gentlemen, and flung bricks at them, and the gentlemen at\\r\\nthem again. So a sharp engagement ensued, but the gentlemen routed them\\r\\nat last, and brought away one or two of the workmen to Graie\\'s Inn; in\\r\\nthis skirmish one or two of the gentlemen and servants of the house were\\r\\nhurt, and severall of the workmen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Ralph\\'s remarks on the principal localities of this district are\\r\\ninteresting. \"Bedford Row,\" he says, \"is one of the most noble streets\\r\\nthat London has to boast of, and yet there is not one house in it which\\r\\ndeserves the least attention.\" He tells us that \"Ormond Street is\\r\\nanother place of pleasure, and that side of it next the Fields is,\\r\\nbeyond question, one of the most charming situations about town.\" This\\r\\n\\'place of pleasure\\' is now given up for the most part to hospitals and\\r\\nother charitable institutions, and to lodging-houses of an inferior\\r\\nsort. Passing on to Bloomsbury Square, and speaking of the Duke of\\r\\nBedford\\'s residence, which stood on the North side of the square, he\\r\\nsays, \"Then behind it has the advantage of most agreeable gardens, and a\\r\\nview of the country, which would make a retreat from the town almost\\r\\nunnecessary, besides the opportunity of exhibiting another prospect of\\r\\nthe building, which would enrich the landscape and challenge new\\r\\napprobation.\" This was written in 1736. At that time the years of two\\r\\ngenerations were appointed to pass away ere the removal of Bedford House\\r\\nshould make way for Lower Bedford Place, leading into Russell Square.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo late as the opening years of George III.\\'s reign, Queen\\'s Square\\r\\nenjoyed an unbroken prospect in the direction of Highgate and Hampstead.\\r\\n\\'The Foreigner\\'s Guide: or a Necessary and Instructive Companion both to\\r\\nthe Foreigner and Native, in their Tours through the Cities of London\\r\\nand Westminster\\' (1763), contains the following passage:--\"Queen\\'s\\r\\nSquare, which is pleasantly situated at the extreme part of the town,\\r\\nhas a fine open view of the country, and is handsomely built, as are\\r\\nlikewise the neighboring streets--viz., Southampton Row, Ormond Street,\\r\\n&c. In this last is Powis House, so named from the Marquis of Powis, who\\r\\nbuilt the present stately structure in the year 1713. It is now the town\\r\\nresidence of the Earl of Hardwicke, late Lord Chancellor. The\\r\\napartments are noble, and the whole edifice is commendable for its\\r\\nsituation, and the fine prospect of the country. Not far from thence is\\r\\nBloomsbury Square. This square is commendable for its situation and\\r\\nlargeness. On the North side is the house of the Duke of Bedford. This\\r\\nbuilding was erected from a design of Inigo Jones, and is very elegant\\r\\nand spacious.\" From the duke\\'s house in Bloomsbury Square and his\\r\\nsurrounding property, the political party, of which he was the Chief,\\r\\nobtained the nickname of the Bloomsbury Gang.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief Justice Holt died March 5, 1710, at his house[3] in Bedford Row.\\r\\nIn Red Lion Square Chief Justice Raymond had the town mansion wherein he\\r\\ndied on April 15, 1733; twelve years after Sir John Pratt, Lord Camden\\'s\\r\\nfather, died at his house in Ormond Street. On December 15, 1761, Chief\\r\\nJustice Willes died at his house in Bloomsbury Square. Chagrin at\\r\\nmissing the seals through his own arrogance, when they had been actually\\r\\noffered to him, was supposed to be a principal cause of the Chief\\r\\nJustice\\'s death. His friends represented that he died of a broken heart;\\r\\nto which assertion flippant enemies responded that no man ever had a\\r\\nheart after living seventy-four years. Murray for many years inhabited a\\r\\nhandsome house in Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields; but his name is more generally\\r\\nassociated with Bloomsbury Square, where stood the house which was\\r\\nsacked and burnt by the Gordon rioters. In Bloomsbury Square our\\r\\ngrandfathers used to lounge, watching the house of Edward Law,\\r\\nsubsequently Lord Ellenborough, in the hope of seeing Mrs. Law, as she\\r\\nwatered the flowers of her balcony. Mrs. Law\\'s maiden name was Towry,\\r\\nand, as a beauty, she remained for years the rage of London. Even at\\r\\nthis date there remain a few aged gentlemen whose eyes sparkle and whose\\r\\nchecks flush when they recall the charms of the lovely creature who\\r\\nbecame the wife of ungainly Edward Law, after refusing him on three\\r\\nseparate occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn becoming Lord Ellenborough and Chief Justice, Edward Law moved to a\\r\\ngreat mansion in St. James\\'s Square, the size of which he described to a\\r\\nfriend by saying: \"Sir, if you let off a piece of ordnance in the hall,\\r\\nthe report is not heard in the bedrooms.\" In this house the Chief\\r\\nJustice expired, on December 13, 1818. Speaking of Lord Ellenborough\\'s\\r\\nresidence in St. James\\'s Square, Lord Campbell says: \"This was the first\\r\\ninstance of a common law judge moving to the \\'West End.\\' Hitherto all\\r\\nthe common law judges had lived within a radius of half a mile from\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn; but they are now spread over the Regent\\'s Park, Hyde Park\\r\\nGardens, and Kensington Gore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Harwicke and Lord Thurlow have been more than once mentioned as\\r\\ninhabitants of Ormond Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nEldon\\'s residences may be noticed with advantage in this place. On\\r\\nleaving Oxford and settling in London, he took a small house for himself\\r\\nand Mrs. Scott in Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane. About this dwelling he\\r\\nwrote to his brother Henry:--\"I have got a house barely sufficient to\\r\\nhold my small family, which (so great is the demand for them here) will,\\r\\nin rent and taxes, cost me annually six pounds.\" To this house he used\\r\\nto point in the days of his prosperity, and, in allusion to the poverty\\r\\nwhich he never experienced, he would add, \"There was my first perch.\\r\\nMany a time have I run down from Cursitor Street to Fleet Market and\\r\\nbought sixpenn\\'orth of sprats for our supper.\" After leaving Cursitor\\r\\nStreet, he lived in Carey Street, Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, where also, in\\r\\nhis later years, he believed himself to have endured such want of money\\r\\nthat he and his wife were glad to fill themselves with sprats. When he\\r\\nfixed this anecdote upon Carey Street, the old Chancellor used to\\r\\nrepresent himself as buying the sprats in Clare Market instead of Fleet\\r\\nMarket. After some successful years he moved his household from the\\r\\nvicinity of Lincoln\\'s Inn, and took a house in the law quarter,\\r\\nselecting one of the roomy houses (No. 42) of Gower Street, where he\\r\\nlived when as Attorney General he conducted the futile prosecutions of\\r\\nHardy, Horne Tooke, and Thelwall, in 1794.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn quitting Gower Street, Eldon took the house in Bedford Square, which\\r\\nwitnessed so many strange scenes during his tenure of the seals, and\\r\\nalso during his brief exclusion from office. In Bedford Square he played\\r\\nthe part of chivalric protector to the Princess of Wales, and chuckled\\r\\nover the proof-sheets of that mysterious \\'book\\' by the publication of\\r\\nwhich the injured wife and the lawyer hoped to take vengeance on their\\r\\ncommon enemy. There the Chancellor, feeling it well to protract his\\r\\nflirtation with the Princess of Wales, entertained her in the June of\\r\\n1808, with a grand banquet, from which Lady Eldon was compelled by\\r\\nindisposition to be absent. And there, four years later, when he was\\r\\nsatisfied that her Royal Highness\\'s good opinion could be of no service\\r\\nto him, the crafty, self-seeking minister gave a still more splendid\\r\\ndinner to the husband whose vices he had professed to abhor, whose\\r\\nmeanness of spirit he had declared the object of his contempt.\\r\\n\"However,\" writes Lord Campbell, with much satiric humor, describing\\r\\nthis alliance between the selfish voluptuary and the equally selfish\\r\\nlawyer, \"he was much comforted by having the honor, at the prorogation,\\r\\nof entertaining at dinner his Royal Highness the Regent, with whom he\\r\\nwas now a special favorite, and who, enjoying the splendid hospitality\\r\\nof Bedford Square, forgot that the Princess of Wales had sat in the same\\r\\nroom; at the same table; on the same chair; had drunk of the same wine;\\r\\nout of the same cup; while the conversation had turned on her barbarous\\r\\nusage, and the best means of publishing to the world _her_ wrongs and\\r\\n_his_ misconduct.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother of the Prince Regent\\'s visits to Bedford Square is surrounded\\r\\nwith comic circumstances and associations. In the April of 1815, a\\r\\nmastership of chancery became vacant by the death of Mr. Morris; and\\r\\nforthwith the Chancellor was assailed with entreaties from every\\r\\ndirection for the vacant post. For two months Eldon, pursuing that\\r\\npolicy of which he was a consummate master, delayed to appoint; but\\r\\non June 23, he disgusted the bar and shocked the more intelligent\\r\\nsection of London society, by conferring the post on Jekyll, the\\r\\ncourtly _bon vivant_ and witty descendant of Sir Joseph Jekyll, Master\\r\\nof the Rolls. Amiable, popular, and brilliant, Jekyll received the\\r\\ncongratulations of his numerous personal friends; but beyond the\\r\\ncircle of his private acquaintance the appointment created lively\\r\\ndissatisfaction--dissatisfaction which was heightened rather than\\r\\ndiminished by the knowledge that the placeman\\'s good fortune was\\r\\nentirely due to the personal importunity of the Prince Regent, who\\r\\ncalled at the Chancellor\\'s house, and having forced his way into the\\r\\nbedroom, to which Eldon was confined by an attack of gout, refused\\r\\nto take his departure without a promise that his friend should have\\r\\nthe vacant place. How this royal influence was applied to the\\r\\nChancellor, is told in the \\'Anecdote Book.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately Jekyll was less incompetent for the post than his enemies\\r\\nhad declared, and his friends admitted. He proved a respectable master,\\r\\nand held his post until age and sickness compelled him to resign it;\\r\\nand then, sustained in spirits by the usual retiring pension, he\\r\\nsauntered on right mirthfully into the valley of the shadow of death. On\\r\\nthe day after his retirement, the jocose veteran, meeting Eldon in the\\r\\nstreet, observed:--\"Yesterday, Lord Chancellor, I was your master;\\r\\nto-day I am my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Bedford Square, Lord Eldon, for once following the fashion, moved\\r\\nto Hamilton Place, Piccadilly. With the purpose of annoying him the\\r\\n\\'Queen\\'s friends,\\' during the height of the \\'Queen Caroline agitation,\\'\\r\\nproposed to buy the house adjoining the Chancellor\\'s residence in\\r\\nHamilton Place, and to fit it up for the habitation of that not\\r\\naltogether meritorious lady. Such an arrangement would have been an\\r\\nhumiliating as well as exasperating insult to a lawyer who, as long as\\r\\nthe excitement about the poor woman lasted, would have been liable to\\r\\naffront whenever he left his house or looked through the windows facing\\r\\nHamilton Place. The same mob that delighted in hallooing round whatever\\r\\nhouse the Queen honored with her presence, would have varied their\\r\\n\\'hurrahs\\' for the lady with groans for the lawyer who, after making her\\r\\nwrongs the stalking-horse of his ambition, had become one of her chief\\r\\noppressors. Eldon determined to leave Hamilton Place on the day which\\r\\nshould see the Queen enter it; and hearing that the Lords of the\\r\\nTreasury were about to assist her with money for the purchase of the\\r\\nhouse, he wrote to Lord Liverpool, protesting against an arrangement\\r\\nwhich would subject him to annoyance at home and to ridicule out of\\r\\ndoors. \"I should,\" he wrote, \"be very unwilling to state anything\\r\\noffensively, but I cannot but express my confidence that Government will\\r\\nnot aid a project which must remove the Chancellor from his house the\\r\\nnext hour that it takes effect, and from his office at the same time.\"\\r\\nThis decided attitude caused the Government to withdraw their\\r\\ncountenance from the project; whereupon a public subscription was opened\\r\\nfor its accomplishment. Sufficient funds were immediately proffered; and\\r\\nthe owner of the mansion had verbally made terms with the patriots, when\\r\\nthe Chancellor, outbidding them, bought the house himself. \"I had no\\r\\nother means,\" he wrote to his daughter, \"of preventing the destruction\\r\\nof my present house as a place in which I could live, or which anybody\\r\\nelse would take. The purchase-money is large, but I have already had\\r\\nsuch offers, that I shall not, I think, lose by it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRussell Square--where Lord Loughborough (who knows aught of the Earl of\\r\\nRosslyn?) had his town house, after leaving Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, and\\r\\nwhere Charles Abbott (Lord Tenterden) established himself on leaving the\\r\\nhouse in Queen Square, into which he married during the summer of\\r\\n1795--maintained a quasi-fashionable repute much later than the older\\r\\nand therefore more interesting parts of the \\'old law quarter.\\' Theodore\\r\\nHook\\'s disdain for Bloomsbury is not rightly appreciated by those who\\r\\nfail to bear in mind that the Russell Square of Hook\\'s time was tenanted\\r\\nby people who--though they were unknown to \\'fashion,\\' in the sense given\\r\\nto the word by men of Brummel\\'s habit and tone--had undeniable status\\r\\namongst the aristocracy and gentry of England. With some justice the\\r\\nwitty writer has been charged with snobbish vulgarity because he\\r\\nridiculed humble Bloomsbury for being humble. His best defence is found\\r\\nin the fact that his extravagant scorn was not directed at helpless and\\r\\naltogether obscure persons so much as at an educated and well-born class\\r\\nwho laughed at his caricatures, and gave dinners at which he was proud\\r\\nto be present. Though it fails to clear the novelist of the special\\r\\ncharge, this apology has a certain amount of truth; and in so far as it\\r\\npalliates some of his offences against good taste and gentle feeling, by\\r\\nall means let him have the full benefit of it. Criticism can afford to\\r\\nbe charitable to the clever, worthless man, now that no one admires or\\r\\ntries to respect him. Again, it may be advanced, in Hook\\'s behalf, that\\r\\npolitical animosity--a less despicable, though not less hurtful passion\\r\\nthan love of gentility--contributed to Hook\\'s dislike of the quarter on\\r\\nthe north side of Holborn. As a humorist he ridiculed, as a panderer to\\r\\nfashionable prejudices he sneered at, Bloomsbury; but as a tory he\\r\\ncherished a genuine antagonism to the district of town that was\\r\\nassociated in the public mind with the wealth and ascendency of the\\r\\nhouse of Bedford. Anyhow, the Russell Square neighborhood--although it\\r\\nwas no longer fashionable, as Belgravia and Mayfair are fashionable at\\r\\nthe present day--remained the locality of many important families, at\\r\\nthe time when Mr. Theodore Hook was pleased to assume that no one above\\r\\nthe condition of a rich tradesman or second-rate attorney lived in it.\\r\\nOf the lawyers whose names are mournfully associated with the square\\r\\nitself are Sir Samuel Romilly and Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd. In 1818, the\\r\\nyear of his destruction by his own hand, Sir Samuel Romilly lived there;\\r\\nand Talfourd had a house on the east side of the square up to the time\\r\\nof his lamented death in 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Theodore Hook\\'s ridicule of Bloomsbury greatly lessened for a time\\r\\nthe value of its houses there is abundant evidence. When he deluged the\\r\\ndistrict with scornful satire, his voice was a social power, to which a\\r\\nconsiderable number of honest people paid servile respect. His clever\\r\\nwords were repeated; and Bloomsbury having become a popular by-word for\\r\\ncontempt, aristocratic families ceased to live, and were reluctant to\\r\\ninvest money, in its well-built mansions. But Hook only accelerated a\\r\\nmovement which had for years been steadily though silently making\\r\\nprogress. Erskine knew Red Lion Square when every house was occupied by\\r\\na lawyer of wealth and eminence, if not of titular rank; but before he\\r\\nquitted the stage, barristers had relinquished the ground in favor of\\r\\nopulent shopkeepers. When an ironmonger became the occupant of a house\\r\\nin Red Lion Square on the removal of a distinguished counsel, Erskine\\r\\nwrote the epigram--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"This house, where once a lawyer dwelt,\\r\\n     Is now a smith\\'s,--alas!\\r\\n   How rapidly the iron age\\r\\n     Succeeds the age of brass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese lines point to a minor change in the social arrangements of\\r\\nLondon, which began with the century, and was still in progress when\\r\\nErskine had for years been mouldering in his grave. In 1823, the year of\\r\\nErskine\\'s death, Chief Baron Richards expired in his town house, in\\r\\nGreat Ormond Street. In the July of the following year Baron\\r\\nWood--_i.e._, George Wood, the famous special pleader--died at his house\\r\\nin Bedford Square, about seventeen months after his resignation of his\\r\\nseat in the Court of Exchequer to John Hullock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the present time the legal fraternity has deserted Bloomsbury. The\\r\\nlast of the Judges to depart was Chief Baron Pollock, who sold his great\\r\\nhouse in Queen Square at a quite recent date. With the disappearance of\\r\\nthis venerable and universally respected judge, the legal history of the\\r\\nneighborhood may be said to have closed. Some wealthy solicitors still\\r\\nlive in Russell Square and the adjoining streets; a few old-fashioned\\r\\nbarristers still linger in Upper Bedford Place and Lower Bedford Place.\\r\\nGuilford Street and Doughty Street, and the adjacent thoroughfares of\\r\\nthe same class, still number a sprinkling of rising juniors, literary\\r\\nbarristers, and fairly prosperous attorneys. Perhaps the ancient aroma\\r\\nof the \\'old law quarter\\'--Mesopotamia, us it is now disrespectfully\\r\\ntermed--is still strong and pleasant enough to attract a few lawyers who\\r\\ncherish a sentimental fondness for the past. A survey of the Post Office\\r\\nDirectory creates an impression that, compared with other neighborhoods,\\r\\nthe district north and northeast of Bloomsbury Square still possesses\\r\\nmore than an average number of legal residents; but it no longer remains\\r\\nthe quarter of the lawyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere still resides in Mecklenburgh Square a learned Queen\\'s Counsel,\\r\\nfor whose preservation the prayers of the neighborhood constantly\\r\\nascend. To his more scholarly and polite neighbors this gentleman is an\\r\\nobject of intellectual interest and anxious affection. As the last of an\\r\\nextinct species, as a still animate Dodo, as a lordly Mohican who has\\r\\noutlived his tribe, this isolated counselor of her Gracious Majesty is\\r\\nwatched by heedful eyes whenever he crosses his threshold. In the\\r\\nmorning, as he paces from his dwelling to chambers, his way down Doughty\\r\\nStreet and John Street, and through Gray\\'s Inn Gardens, is guarded by\\r\\nmen anxious for his safety. Shreds of orange-peel are whisked from the\\r\\npavement on which he is about to tread; and when he crosses Holborn he\\r\\nwalks between those who would imperil their lives to rescue him from\\r\\ndanger. The gatekeeper in Doughty Street daily makes him low obeisance,\\r\\nknowing the historic value and interest of his courtly presence.\\r\\nOccasionally the inhabitants of Mecklenburgh Square whisper a fear that\\r\\nsome sad morning their Q.C. may flit away without giving them a warning.\\r\\nLong may it be before the residents of the \\'Old Law Quarter\\' shall wail\\r\\nover the fulfillment of this dismal anticipation!\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Dr. Clench lived in Brownlow Street, Holborn; and until his death,\\r\\nin 1831, John Abernethy occupied in Bedford Row the house which is still\\r\\ninhabited by an eminent surgeon, who was Abernethy\\'s favorite pupil. Of\\r\\nDr. Clench\\'s death in January, 1691-2, Narcissus Luttrell gives the\\r\\nfollowing account: \"The 5th, last night, Dr. Clench, the physician, was\\r\\nstrangled in a coach; two persons came to his house in Brownlow Street,\\r\\nHolborn, in a coach, and pretended to carry him to a patient\\'s in the\\r\\nCity; they drove backward and forward, and after some time stopt by\\r\\nLeadenhall, and sent the coachman to buy a couple of fowls for supper,\\r\\nwho went accordingly; and in the meantime they slipt away, and the\\r\\ncoachman when he returned found Dr. Clench with a handkerchief tyed\\r\\nabout his neck, with a hard sea-coal twisted in it, and clapt against\\r\\nhis windpipe; he had spirits applied to him and other means, but too\\r\\nlate, he having been dead some time.\" Dr. Clench\\'s murderer, one Mr.\\r\\nHarrison, a man of gentle condition, was apprehended, tried, found\\r\\nguilty, and hung in chains.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] Holt\\'s country seat was Redgrave Hall, formerly the home of the\\r\\nBacons. It was on his manor of Redgrave, that Sir Nicholas Bacon\\r\\nentertained Queen Elizabeth, when she remarked that her Lord Keeper\\'s\\r\\nhouse was too small for him, and he answered--\"Your Majesty has made me\\r\\ntoo great for my house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOVES OF THE LAWYERS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA LOTTERY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would compare the multitude of women which are to be chosen for wives\\r\\nunto a bag full of snakes, having among them a single eel; now if a man\\r\\nshould put his hand into this bag, he may chance to light on the eel;\\r\\nbut it is an hundred to one he shall be stung by a snake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words were often heard from the lips of that honest judge, Sir\\r\\nJohn More, whose son Thomas stirred from brain to foot by the bright\\r\\neyes, and snowy neck, and flowing locks of _cara Elizabetha_ (the _cara\\r\\nElizabetha_ of a more recent Tom More was \\'Bessie, my darling\\')--penned\\r\\nthose warm and sweetly-flowing verses which delight scholars of the\\r\\npresent generation, and of which the following lines are neither the\\r\\nleast musical nor the least characteristic:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Jam subit illa dies quæ ludentem obtulit olim\\r\\n     Inter virgineos te mibi prima choros.\\r\\n   Lactea cum flavi decuerunt colla capilli,\\r\\n     Cum gena par nivibus visa, labella rosis:\\r\\n   Cum tua perstringunt oculos duo sydera nostros\\r\\n     Perque oculos intrant in mea corda meos.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goddess of love played the poet more than one droll trick. Having\\r\\napproached her with musical flattery, he fled from her with fear and\\r\\nabhorrence. For a time the highest and holiest of human affections was\\r\\nto his darkened mind no more than a carnal appetite; and he strove to\\r\\nconquer the emotions which he feared would rouse within him a riot of\\r\\nimpious passions. With fasting and cruel discipline he would fain have\\r\\nkilled the devil that agitated him, whenever he passed a pretty girl in\\r\\nthe street. As a lay Carthusian he wore a hair-shirt next his skin,\\r\\ndisciplined his bare back with scourges, slept on the cold ground or a\\r\\nhard bench, and by a score other strong measures sought to preserve his\\r\\nspiritual by ruining his bodily health. But nature was too powerful for\\r\\nunwholesome doctrine and usage, and before he rashly took a celibatic\\r\\nvow, he knelt to fair Jane Colt--and rising, kissed her on the lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen spiritual counsel had removed his conscientious objections to\\r\\nmatrimony, he could not condescend to marry for love, but must,\\r\\nforsooth, choose his wife in obedience to considerations of compassion\\r\\nand mercy. Loving her younger sister, he paid his addresses to Jane,\\r\\nbecause he shrunk from the injustice of putting the junior above the\\r\\nolder of the two girls. \"Sir Thomas having determined, by the advice and\\r\\ndirection of his ghostly father, to be a married man, there was at that\\r\\ntime a pleasant conceited gentleman of an ancient family in Essex, one\\r\\nMr. John Colt, of New Hall, that invited him into his house, being much\\r\\ndelighted in his company, proffering unto him the choice of any of his\\r\\ndaughters, who were young gentlewomen of very good carriage, good\\r\\ncomplexions, and very religiously inclined; whose honest and sweet\\r\\nconversation and virtuous education enticed Sir Thomas not a little; and\\r\\nalthough his affection most served him to the second, for that he\\r\\nthought her the fairest and best favored, yet when he thought within\\r\\nhimself that it would be a grief and some blemish to the eldest to have\\r\\nthe younger sister preferred before her, he, out of a kind of\\r\\ncompassion, settled his fancy upon the eldest, and soon after married\\r\\nher with all his friends\\' good liking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marriage was a fair happy union, but its duration was short. After\\r\\ngiving birth to four children Jane died, leaving the young husband, who\\r\\nhad instructed her sedulously, to mourn her sincerely. That his sorrow\\r\\nwas poignant may be easily believed; for her death deprived him of a\\r\\ndocile pupil, as well as a dutiful wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Virginem duxit admodum puellam,\" Erasmus says of his friend, \"claro\\r\\ngenere natam, rudem adhuc utpote ruri inter parentes ac sorores semper\\r\\nhabitam, quo magis illi liceret illam ad suos mores fingere. Hanc et\\r\\nliteris instruendam curavit, et omni musices genere doctam reddidit.\"\\r\\nHere is another insight into the considerations which brought about the\\r\\nmarriage. When he set out in search of a wife, he wished to capture a\\r\\nsimple, unsophisticated, untaught country girl, whose ignorance of the\\r\\nworld should incline her to rely on his superior knowledge, and the\\r\\ndeficiencies of whose intellectual training should leave him an ample\\r\\nfield for educational experiments. Seeking this he naturally turned his\\r\\nsteps toward the eastern countries; and in Essex he found the young\\r\\nlady, who to the last learnt with intelligence and zeal the lessons\\r\\nwhich he set her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore\\'s second choice of a wife was less fortunate than his first.\\r\\nWanting a woman to take care of his children and preside over his rather\\r\\nnumerous establishment, he made an offer to a widow, named Alice\\r\\nMiddleton. Plain and homely in appearance and taste, Mistress Alice\\r\\nwould have been invaluable to Sir Thomas as a superior domestic servant,\\r\\nbut his good judgment and taste deserted him when he decided to make\\r\\nher a closer companion. Bustling, keen, loquacious, tart, the good dame\\r\\nscolded servants and petty tradesmen with admirable effect; but even at\\r\\nthis distance of time the sensitive ear is pained by her sharp,\\r\\ngarrulous tongue, when its acerbity and virulence are turned against her\\r\\npacific and scholarly husband. A smile follows the recollection that he\\r\\nendeavored to soften her manners and elevate her nature by a system of\\r\\nculture similar to that by which Jane Colt, \\'admodum puella,\\' had been\\r\\nformed and raised into a polished gentlewoman. Past forty years of age,\\r\\nMistress Alice was required to educate herself anew. Erasmus assures his\\r\\nreaders that \"though verging on old age, and not of a yielding temper,\"\\r\\nshe was prevailed upon \"to take lessons on the lute, the cithara, the\\r\\nviol, the monochord, and the flute, which she daily practised to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been the fashion with biographers to speak bitterly of this poor\\r\\nwoman, and to pity More for his cruel fate in being united to a\\r\\ntermagant. No one has any compassion for her. Sir Thomas is the victim;\\r\\nMistress Alice the shrill virago. In those days, when every historic\\r\\nreprobate finds an apologist, is there no one to say a word in behalf of\\r\\nthe Widow Middleton, whose lot in life and death seems to this writer\\r\\nvery pitiable? She was quick in temper, slow in brain, domineering,\\r\\nawkward. To rouse sympathy for such a woman is no easy task; but if\\r\\nwretchedness is a title to compassion, Mistress Alice has a right to\\r\\ncharity and gentle usage. It _was not_ her fault that she could not\\r\\nsympathize with her grand husband, in his studies and tastes, his lofty\\r\\nlife and voluntary death; it _was_ her misfortune that his steps\\r\\ntraversed plains high above her own moral and intellectual level. By\\r\\nsocial theory they were intimate companions; in reality, no man and\\r\\nwoman in all England were wider apart. From his elevation he looked\\r\\ndown on her with commiseration that was heightened by curiosity and\\r\\namazement; and she daily writhed under his gracious condescension and\\r\\npassionless urbanity; under her own consciousness of inferiority and\\r\\nconsequent self-scorn. He could no more sympathize with her petty aims,\\r\\nthan she with the high views and ambitions; and conjugal sympathy was\\r\\nfar more necessary to her than to him. His studious friends and clever\\r\\nchildren afforded him an abundance of human fellowship; his public cares\\r\\nand intellectual pursuits gave him constant diversion. He stood in such\\r\\nsmall need of her, that if some benevolent fairy had suddenly endowed\\r\\nher with grace, wisdom, and understanding, the sum of his satisfaction\\r\\nwould not have been perceptibly altered. But apart from him she had no\\r\\nsufficient enjoyments. His genuine companionship was requisite for her\\r\\nhappiness; but for this society nature had endowed her with no fitness.\\r\\nIn the case of an unhappy marriage, where the unhappiness is not caused\\r\\nby actual misconduct, but is solely due to incongruity of tastes and\\r\\ncapacities, it is cruel to assume that the superior person of the\\r\\nill-assorted couple has the stronger claim to sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding his wife less tractable than he wished, More withheld his\\r\\nconfidence from her, taking the most important steps of his life,\\r\\nwithout either asking for her advice, or even announcing the course\\r\\nwhich he was about to take. His resignation of the seals was announced\\r\\nto her on the day _after_ his retirement from office, and in a manner\\r\\nwhich, notwithstanding its drollery, would greatly pain any woman of\\r\\nordinary sensibility. The day following the date of his resignation was\\r\\na holiday; and in accordance with his usage the ex-Chancellor, together\\r\\nwith his household, attended service in Chelsea Church. On her way to\\r\\nchurch, Lady More returned the greetings of her friends with a\\r\\nstateliness not unseemly at that ceremonious time in one who was the\\r\\nlady of the Lord High Chancellor. At the conclusion of service, ere she\\r\\nleft her pew, the intelligence was broken to her in a jest that she had\\r\\nlost her cherished dignity. \"And whereas upon the holidays during his\\r\\nHigh Chancellorship one of his gentlemen, when the service of the church\\r\\nwas done, ordinarily used to come to my lady his wife\\'s pew-door, and\\r\\nsay unto her \\'_Madam, my lord is gone_,\\' he came into my lady his wife\\'s\\r\\npew himself, and making a low courtesy, said unto her, \\'Madam, my lord\\r\\nis gone,\\' which she, imagining to be but one of his jests, as he used\\r\\nmany unto her, he sadly affirmed unto her that it was true. This was the\\r\\nway he thought fittest to break the matter unto his wife, who was full\\r\\nof sorrow to hear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEqually humorous and pathetic was that memorable interview between More\\r\\nand his wife in the Tower, when she, regarding his position by the\\r\\nlights with which nature had endowed her, counseled him to yield even at\\r\\nthat late moment to the king. \"What the goodyear, Mr. More!\" she cried,\\r\\nbustling up to the tranquil and courageous man. \"I marvel that you, who\\r\\nhave been hitherto always taken for a wise man, will now so play the\\r\\nfool as to lie here in this close, filthy prison, and be content to be\\r\\nshut up thus with mice and rats, when you might be abroad at your\\r\\nliberty, with the favor and good-will both of the king and his council,\\r\\nif you would but do as the bishops and best learned of his realm have\\r\\ndone; and, seeing you have at Chelsea a right fair house, your library,\\r\\nyour books, your gallery, and all other necessaries so handsome about\\r\\nyou, where you might, in company with me, your wife, your children, and\\r\\nhousehold, be merry, I muse what, in God\\'s name, you mean, here thus\\r\\nfondly to tarry.\" Having heard her out--preserving his good-humor, he\\r\\nsaid to her, with a cheerful countenance, \"I pray thee, good Mrs.\\r\\nAlice, tell me one thing!\" \"What is it?\" saith she, \"Is not this house\\r\\nas near heaven as my own?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas More was looking towards heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nMistress Alice had her eye upon the \\'right fair house\\' at Chelsea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOOD QUEEN BESS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the eminent men who are frequently mentioned as notorious\\r\\nsuitors for the personal affection of Queen Elizabeth, a conspicuous\\r\\nplace is awarded to Hatton, by the scandalous memoirs of his time and\\r\\nthe romantic traditions of later ages. Historians of the present\\r\\ngeneration have accepted without suspicion the story that Hatton was\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s amorous courtier, that the fanciful letters of \\'Lydds\\' were\\r\\nfervent solicitations for response to his passion; that he won her favor\\r\\nand his successive promotions by timely exhibition of personal grace and\\r\\nsteady perseverance in flattery. Campbell speaks of the queen and her\\r\\nchancellor as \\'lovers;\\' and the view of the historian has been upheld by\\r\\nnovelists and dramatic writers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writer of this page ventures to reject a story which is not\\r\\nconsistent with truth, and casts a dark suspicion on her who was not\\r\\nmore powerful as a queen than virtuous as a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor illustrations of lovers\\' pranks amongst the Elizabethan lawyers, the\\r\\nreader must pass to two great judges, the inferior of whom was a far\\r\\ngreater man than Christopher Hatton. Rivals in law and politics, Bacon\\r\\nand Coke were also rivals in love. Having wooed the same proud, lovely,\\r\\ncapricious, violent woman, the one was blessed with failure, and the\\r\\nother was cursed with success.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil a revolution in the popular estimate of Bacon was effected by Mr.\\r\\nHepworth Dixon\\'s vindication of that great man, it was generally\\r\\nbelieved that love was no appreciable element in his nature. Delight in\\r\\nvain display occupied in his affections the place which should have been\\r\\nheld by devotion to womanly beauty and goodness; he had sneered at love\\r\\nin an essay, and his cold heart never rebelled against the doctrine of\\r\\nhis clever brain; he wooed his notorious cousin for the sake of power,\\r\\nand then married Alice Barnham for money. Such was the theory, the most\\r\\nsolid foundation of which was a humorous treatise,[4] misread and\\r\\nmisapplied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady\\'s wealth, rank, and personal attractions were in truth the only\\r\\nfacts countenancing the suggestion that Francis Bacon proffered suit to\\r\\nhis fair cousin from interested motives. Notwithstanding her defects of\\r\\ntemper, no one denies that she was a woman qualified by nature to rouse\\r\\nthe passion of man. A wit and beauty, she was mistress of the arts which\\r\\nheighten the powers of feminine tact and loveliness. The daughter of Sir\\r\\nThomas Cecil, the grandchild of Lord Burleigh, she was Francis Bacon\\'s\\r\\nnear relation; and though the Cecils were not inclined to help him to\\r\\nfortune, he was nevertheless one of their connection, and consequently\\r\\noften found himself in familiar conversation with the bright and\\r\\nfascinating woman. Doubtless she played with him, persuading herself\\r\\nthat she merely treated him with cousinly cordiality, when she was\\r\\ndesignedly making him her lover. The marvel was that she did not give\\r\\nhim her hand; that he sought it is no occasion for surprise--or for\\r\\ninsinuations that he coveted her wealth. Biography is by turns\\r\\nmischievously communicative and vexatiously silent. That Bacon loved Sir\\r\\nWilliam Hatton\\'s widow, and induced Essex to support his suit, and that\\r\\nrejecting him she gave herself to his enemy, we know; but history tells\\r\\nus nothing of the secret struggle which preceded the lady\\'s resolution\\r\\nto become the wife of an unalluring, ungracious, peevish, middle-aged\\r\\nwidower. She must have felt some tenderness for her cousin, whose\\r\\ncomeliness spoke to every eye, whose wit was extolled by every lip.\\r\\nPerhaps she, like many others, had misread the essay \\'Of Love,\\' and felt\\r\\nherself bound in honor to bring the philosopher to his knees at her\\r\\nfeet. It is credible that from the outset of their sentimental\\r\\nintercourse, she intended to win and then to flout him. But coquetry\\r\\ncannot conquer the first laws of human feeling. To be a good flirt, a\\r\\nwoman must have nerve and a sympathetic nature; and doubtless the flirt\\r\\nin this instance paid for her triumph with the smart of a lasting wound.\\r\\nIs it fanciful to argue that her subsequent violence and misconduct, her\\r\\nimpatience of control and scandalous disrespect for her aged husband,\\r\\nmay have been in some part due to the sacrifice of personal inclination\\r\\nwhich she made in accepting Coke at the entreaty of prudent and selfish\\r\\nrelations--and to the contrast, perpetually haunting her, between what\\r\\nshe was as Sir Edward\\'s termagant partner, and what she might have been\\r\\nas Francis Bacon\\'s wife?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe consented to a marriage with Edward Coke, but was so ashamed of her\\r\\nchoice, that she insisted on a private celebration of their union,\\r\\nalthough Archbishop Whitgift had recently raised his voice against the\\r\\nscandal of clandestine weddings, and had actually forbidden them. In the\\r\\nface of the primate\\'s edict the ill-assorted couple were united in\\r\\nwedlock, without license or publication of banns, by a country parson,\\r\\nwho braved the displeasure of Whitgift, in order that he might secure\\r\\nthe favor of a secular patron. The wedding-day was November 24, 1598,\\r\\nthe bridegroom\\'s first wife having been buried on the 24th of the\\r\\nprevious July.[5] On learning the violation of his orders, the\\r\\narchbishop was so incensed that he resolved to excommunicate the\\r\\noffenders, and actually instituted for that purpose legal proceedings,\\r\\nwhich were not dropped until bride and bridegroom humbly sued for\\r\\npardon, pleading ignorance of law in excuse of their misbehavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scandalous consequences of that marriage are known to every reader\\r\\nwho has laughed over the more pungent and comic scenes of English\\r\\nhistory. Whilst Lady Hatton gave masques and balls in the superb palace\\r\\nwhich came into her possession through marriage with Sir Christopher\\r\\nHatton\\'s nephew, Coke lived in his chambers, working at cases and\\r\\nwriting the books which are still carefully studied by every young man\\r\\nwho wishes to make himself a master of our law. In private they had\\r\\nperpetual squabbles, and they quarrelled with equal virulence and\\r\\nindecency before the world. The matrimonial settlement of their only and\\r\\nill-starred daughter was the occasion of an outbreak on the part of\\r\\nhusband and wife, that not only furnished diversion for courtiers but\\r\\nagitated the council table. Of all the comic scenes connected with that\\r\\nunseemly _fracas_, not the least laughable and characteristic was the\\r\\ngrand festival of reconciliation at Hatton House, when Lady Hatton\\r\\nreceived the king and queen in Holborn, and expressly forbade her\\r\\nhusband to presume to show himself among her guests. \"The expectancy of\\r\\nSir Edward\\'s rising,\" says a writer of the period,[6] \"is much abated by\\r\\nreason of his lady\\'s liberty,[7] who was brought in great honor to\\r\\nExeter House by my Lord of Buckingham from Sir William Craven\\'s, whither\\r\\nshe had been remanded, presented by his lordship to the king, received\\r\\ngracious usage, reconciled to her daughter by his Majesty, and her house\\r\\nin Holborn enlightened by his presence at a dinner, where there was a\\r\\nroyal feast; and to make it more absolutely her own, express\\r\\ncommandment given by her ladyship, that neither Sir Edward Coke nor any\\r\\nof his servants should be admitted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf tradition may be credited, the law is greatly indebted to the class\\r\\nof women whom it was our forefathers\\' barbarous wont to punish with the\\r\\nducking-stool. Had Coke been happy in his second marriage, it is assumed\\r\\nthat he would have spent more time in pleasure and fewer hours at his\\r\\ndesk, that the suitors in his court would have had less careful\\r\\ndecisions, and that posterity would have been favored with fewer\\r\\nreports. If the inference is just, society may point to the commentary\\r\\non Littleton, and be thankful for the lady\\'s unhappy temper and sharp\\r\\ntongue. In like manner the wits of the following century maintained that\\r\\nHolt\\'s steady application to business was a consequence of domestic\\r\\nmisery. The lady who ruled his house in Bedford Row, is said to have\\r\\nbeen such a virago, that the Chief Justice frequently retired to his\\r\\nchambers, in order that he might place himself beyond reach of her\\r\\nvoice. Amongst the good stories told of Radcliffe, the Tory physician,\\r\\nis the tradition of his boast, that he kept Lady Holt alive out of pure\\r\\npolitical animosity to the Whig Chief Justice. Another eminent lawyer,\\r\\nover whose troubles people have made merry in the same fashion, was\\r\\nJeffrey Gilbert, Baron of the Exchequer. At his death, October 14, 1726,\\r\\nthis learned judge left behind him that mass of reports, histories, and\\r\\ntreatises by which he is known as one of the most luminous, as well as\\r\\nvoluminous of legal writers. None of his works passed through the press\\r\\nduring his life, and when their number and value were discovered after\\r\\nhis departure to another world, it was whispered that they had been\\r\\ncomposed in hours of banishment from a hearth where a _scolding wife_\\r\\nmade misery for all who came within the range of her querulous notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisappointed in his suit to his beautiful and domineering cousin, Bacon\\r\\nlet some five or six years pass before he allowed his thoughts again to\\r\\nturn to love, and then he wooed and waited for nearly three years more,\\r\\nere, on a bright May day, he met Alice Barnham in Marylebone Chapel, and\\r\\nmade her his wife in the presence of a courtly company. In the July of\\r\\n1603, he wrote to Cecil:--\"For this divulged and almost prostituted\\r\\ntitle of knighthood, I could, without charge by your honor\\'s mean, be\\r\\ncontent to have it, both because of this late disgrace, and because I\\r\\nhave three new knights in my mess in Gray\\'s Inn Commons, and because I\\r\\nhave found out an alderman\\'s daughter, a handsome maiden, to my liking.\\r\\nSo as if your honor will find the time, I will come to the court from\\r\\nGorhambury upon any warning.\" This expression, \\'an alderman\\'s daughter,\\'\\r\\ncontributed greatly, if it did not give rise to, the misapprehension\\r\\nthat Bacon\\'s marriage was a mercenary arrangement. In these later times\\r\\nthe social status of an alderman is so much beneath the rank of a\\r\\ndistinguished member of the bar, that a successful queen\\'s counsel, who\\r\\nshould make an offer to the daughter of a City magistrate, would be\\r\\nregarded as bent upon a decidedly unambitious match; and if in a\\r\\nsignificant tone he spoke of the lady as \\'an alderman\\'s daughter\\' his\\r\\nwords might be reasonably construed as a hint that her fortune atoned\\r\\nfor her want of rank. But it never occurred to Bacon\\'s contemporaries to\\r\\nput such a construction on the announcement. Far from using the words in\\r\\nan apologetic manner, the lover meant them to express concisely that\\r\\nAlice Barnham was a lady of suitable condition to bear a title as well\\r\\nas to become his bride. Cecil regarded them merely as an assurance that\\r\\nhis relative meditated a suitable and even advantageous alliance, just\\r\\nas any statesman of the present day would read an announcement that a\\r\\nkinsman, making his way in the law-courts, intended to marry \\'an\\r\\nadmiral\\'s daughter\\' or a \\'bishop\\'s daughter.\\' That it was the reverse of\\r\\na mercenary marriage, Mr. Hepworth Dixon has indisputably proved in his\\r\\neighth chapter of \\'The Story of Lord Bacon\\'s Life,\\' where he contrasts\\r\\nLady Bacon\\'s modest fortune with her husband\\'s personal acquisitions and\\r\\nprospects.\\r\\n\\r\\n[4] To readers who have no sense of humor and irony, the essay \\'Of Love\\'\\r\\nunquestionably gives countenance to the theory that Francis Bacon was\\r\\ncold and passionless in all that concerned woman. Of the many strange\\r\\nconstructions put upon this essay, not the least amusing and perverse is\\r\\nthat which would make it a piece of adroit flattery to Elizabeth, who\\r\\nnever permitted love \"to check with business,\" though she is represented\\r\\nto have used it as a diversion in idle moments. If Sir Thomas More\\'s\\r\\n\\'Utopia\\' had been published a quarter of a century after 1518 (the date\\r\\nof its appearance), a similar construction would have been put on the\\r\\npassage, which urges that lovers should not be bound by an indissoluble\\r\\ntie of wedlock, until mutual inspection has satisfied each of the\\r\\ncontracting parties that the other does not labor under any grave\\r\\npersonal defect. If it were possible to regard the passage containing\\r\\nthis proposal as an interpolation in the original romance, it might then\\r\\nbe regarded as an attempt to palliate Henry VIII.\\'s conduct to Anne of\\r\\nCleves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[5] When due allowance has been made for the difference between the\\r\\nusages of the sixteenth century and the present time, decency was\\r\\nsignally violated by this marriage, which followed so soon upon Mrs.\\r\\nCoke\\'s death, and still sooner upon the death of Lady Hatton\\'s famous\\r\\ngrandfather, at whose funeral the lawyer made the first overtures for\\r\\nher hand. Mrs. Coke died June 27, 1598, and was buried at Huntingfield,\\r\\nco. Suffolk, July 24, 1598. Lord Burleigh expired on August 4, of the\\r\\nsame year. Coke\\'s first marriage was not unhappy; and on the death of\\r\\nhis wife by that union, he wrote in his note-book:--\"Most beloved and\\r\\nmost excellent wife, she well and happily lived, and, as a true handmaid\\r\\nof the Lord, fell asleep in the Lord, and now lives and reigns in\\r\\nheaven.\" In after years he often wished most cordially that he could say\\r\\n_as much_ for his second wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n[6] Strafford\\'s Letters and Despatches, I. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n[7] Lady Hatton never used her second husband\\'s name either before or\\r\\nafter his knighthood. A good case, touching the customary right of a\\r\\nmarried lady to bear the name, and take her title from the rank of a\\r\\nformer husband, is that of Sir Dudley North, Charles II.\\'s notorious\\r\\nsheriff of London. The son of an English peer, he married Lady Gunning,\\r\\nthe widow of a wealthy civic knight, and daughter of Sir Robert Cann, \"a\\r\\nmorose old merchant of Bristol\"--the same magistrate whom Judge\\r\\nJeffreys, in terms not less just than emphatic, upbraided for his\\r\\nconnection with, or to speak moderately, his connivance at, the Bristol\\r\\nkidnappers. It might be thought that the merchant\\'s daughter, on her\\r\\nmarriage with a peer\\'s son, would be well content to relinquish the\\r\\ntitle of Lady Gunning; but Roger North tells us that his brother Dudley\\r\\naccepted knighthood, in order that he might avoid giving offence to the\\r\\ncity, and also, in order that his wife might be called Lady North, and\\r\\nnot Lady Gunning.--_Vide Life of the Hon. Sir Dudley North._ After Sir\\r\\nThomas Wilde (subsequently Lord Truro), married Augusta Emma d\\'Este, the\\r\\ndaughter of the duke of Sussex and Lady Augusta Murray, that lady, of\\r\\nwhose legitimacy Sir Thomas had vainly endeavored to convince the House\\r\\nof Lords, retained her maiden surname. In society she was generally\\r\\nknown as the Princess d\\'Este, and the bilious satirists of the Inns of\\r\\nCourt used to speak of Sir Thomas as \\'the Prince.\\' It was said that one\\r\\nof Wilde\\'s familiar associates, soon after the lawyer\\'s marriage, called\\r\\nat his house and asked if the Princess d\\'Este was at home. \"No, sir,\"\\r\\nreplied the servant, \"the Princess d\\'Este is not at home, but the Prince\\r\\nis!\" That this malicious story obtained a wide currency is not\\r\\nwonderful; that it is a truthful anecdote the writer of this book would\\r\\nnot like to pledge his credit. The case of Sir John Campbell and Lady\\r\\nStrathedon, was a notable instance of a lawyer and his wife bearing\\r\\ndifferent names. Raised to the peerage, with the title of Baroness\\r\\nStratheden, the first Lord Abinger\\'s eldest daughter was indebted to her\\r\\nhusband for an honor that made him her social inferior. Many readers\\r\\nwill remember a droll story of a misapprehension caused by her\\r\\nladyship\\'s title. During an official journey, Sir John Campbell and\\r\\nBaroness Stratheden slept at lodgings which he had frequently occupied\\r\\nas a circuiteer. On the morning after his arrival, the landlady obtained\\r\\na special interview with Campbell, and in the baroness\\'s absence thus\\r\\naddressed him, with mingled indignation and respectfulness:--\"Sir John\\r\\nCampbell, I am a lone widow, and live by my good name. It is not in my\\r\\nhumble place to be too curious about the ladies brought to my lodgings\\r\\nby counsellors and judges. It is not in me to make remarks if a\\r\\ncounsellor\\'s lady changes the color of her eyes, and her complexion\\r\\nevery assizes. But, Sir John, a gentleman ought not to bring a lady to a\\r\\nlone widow\\'s lodgings, unless so long as he \\'okkipies\\' the apartments he\\r\\nmakes all honorable professions that the lady is his wife, and as such\\r\\ngives her the use of his name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nREJECTED ADDRESSES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo lawyer of the Second Charles\\'s time surpassed Francis North in love\\r\\nof money, or was more firmly resolved not to marry, without due and\\r\\nsubstantial consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first proposal was for the daughter of a Gray\\'s Inn money-lender.\\r\\nUsury was not a less contemptible vocation in the seventeenth century\\r\\nthan it is at the present time; and most young barristers of gentle\\r\\ndescent and fair prospects would have preferred any lot to the\\r\\ndegradation of marriage with the child of the most fortunate usurer in\\r\\nCharles II.\\'s London. But the Hon. Francis North was placed comfortably\\r\\n_beneath_ the prejudices of his order and time of life. He was of noble\\r\\nbirth, but quite ready to marry into a plebeian family; he was young,\\r\\nbut loved money more than aught else. So his hearing was quickened and\\r\\nhis blood beat merrily when, one fine morning, \"there came to him a\\r\\nrecommendation of a lady, who was an only daughter of an old usurer in\\r\\nGray\\'s Inn, supposed to be a good fortune in present, for her father was\\r\\nrich; but, after his death, to become worth, nobody could tell what.\"\\r\\nOne would like to know how that \\'recommendation of a lady\\' reached the\\r\\nlawyer\\'s chambers; above all, who sent it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His lordship,\" continues Roger North, \"got a sight of the lady, and did\\r\\nnot dislike her; thereupon he made the old man a visit, and a proposal\\r\\nof himself to marry his daughter.\" By all means let this ingenuous,\\r\\nhigh-spirited Templar have a fair judgment. He would not have sold\\r\\nhimself to just any woman. He required a _maximum_ of wealth with a\\r\\n_minimum_ of personal repulsiveness. He therefore \\'took a sight of the\\r\\nlady\\' (it does not appear that he talked with her) before he committed\\r\\nhimself irrevocably by a proposal. The _sight_ having been taken, as he\\r\\ndid not dislike her (mind, he did not positively like her) he made the\\r\\nold man a visit. Loving money, and believing in it, this \\'old man\\'\\r\\nwished to secure as much of it as possible for his only child; and\\r\\ntherefore looking keenly at the youthful admirer of a usurer\\'s heiress,\\r\\n\"asked him what estate his father intended to settle upon him for\\r\\npresent maintenance, jointure, and provision for children.\" Mildly and\\r\\nnot unjustly Roger calls this \"an inauspicious question.\" It was so\\r\\ninauspicious that Mr. Francis North abruptly terminated the discussion\\r\\nby wishing the usurer good-morning. So ended Love Affair No. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving lost his dear companion, Mr. Edward Palmer, son of the powerful\\r\\nSir Geoffry Palmer, Mr. Francis North soon regarded his friend\\'s wife\\r\\nwith tender longing. It was only natural that he should desire to\\r\\nmitigate his sorrow for the dead by possession of the woman who was\\r\\n\"left a flourishing widow, and very rich.\" But the lady knew her worth,\\r\\nas well she might, for \"never was lady more closely besieged with\\r\\nwooers: she had no less than five younger sons sat down before her at\\r\\none time, and she kept them well in hand, as they say, giving no\\r\\ndefinite answers to any of one of them.\" Small respect did Mistress\\r\\nEdward Palmer show her late husband\\'s most intimate friend. For weeks\\r\\nshe tortured the wretched, knavish fellow with coquettish tricks, and\\r\\nhaving rendered him miserable in many ways, made him ludicrous by\\r\\njilting him. \"He was held at the long saw above a month, doing his duty\\r\\nas well as he might, and that was but clumsily; for he neither dressed\\r\\nnor danced, when his rivals were adroit at both, and the lady used to\\r\\nshuffle her favors amongst them affectedly, and on purpose to mortify\\r\\nhis lordship, and at the same time be as civil to him, with like purpose\\r\\nto mortify them.\" Poor Mr. Francis! Well may his brother write\\r\\nindignantly, \"It was very grievous to him--that had his thoughts upon\\r\\nhis clients\\' concerns, which came in thick upon him--to be held in a\\r\\ncourse of bo-peep play with a crafty widow.\" At length, \"after a\\r\\nclancular proceeding,\" this crafty widow, by marrying \"a jolly knight of\\r\\na good estate,\" set her victims free; and Mr. Francis was at liberty to\\r\\nlook elsewhere for a lapful of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger North tells the story of the third affair so concisely and pithily\\r\\nthat his exact words must be put before the reader:--\"Another\\r\\nproposition came to his lordship,\" writes the fraternal biographer,\\r\\ngiving Francis North credit for the title he subsequently won, although\\r\\nat the time under consideration he was plain _Mister_ North, on the keen\\r\\nlook-out for the place of Solicitor General, \"by a city broker, from Sir\\r\\nJohn Lawrence, who had many daughters, and those reputed beauties; and\\r\\nthe fortune was to be £6000. His lordship went and dined with the\\r\\nalderman, and liked the lady, who (as the way is) was dressed out for a\\r\\nmuster. And coming to treat, the portion shrank to £5000, and upon that\\r\\nhis lordship parted, and was not gone far before Mr. Broker (following)\\r\\ncame to him, and said Sir John would give £500 more at the birth of the\\r\\nfirst child; but that would not do, for his lordship hated such\\r\\nscrewing. Not long after this dispute, his lordship was made the King\\'s\\r\\nSolicitor General, and then the broker came again, with news that Sir\\r\\nJohn would give £10,000. \\'No,\\' his lordship said, \\'after such usage he\\r\\nwould not proceed if he might have £20,000.\\'\" The intervention of the\\r\\nbroker in this negotiation is delightfully suggestive. More should have\\r\\nbeen said about him--his name, address, and terms for doing business.\\r\\nWas he paid for his services on all that he could save from a certain\\r\\nsum beyond which his employer would not advance a single gold-piece for\\r\\nthe disposal of his child? Were there, in olden time, men who avowed\\r\\nthemselves \\'Heart and Jointure Brokers, Agents for Lovers of both Sexes,\\r\\nContractors of Mutual Attachments, Wholesale and Retail Dealers in\\r\\nReciprocal Affection, and General Referees, Respondents, and Insurers in\\r\\nall Sentimental Affairs, Clandestine or otherwise?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these mischances Francis North made an eligible match under\\r\\nsomewhat singular circumstances. As co-heiresses of Thomas, Earl of\\r\\nDown, three sisters, the Ladies Pope, claimed under certain settlements\\r\\nlarge estates of inheritance, to which Lady Elizabeth Lee set up a\\r\\ncounter claim. North, acting as Lady Elizabeth Lee\\'s counsel, effected a\\r\\ncompromise which secured half the property in dispute to his client, and\\r\\ndiminished by one-half the fortunes to which each of the three suitors\\r\\non the other side had maintained their right. Having thus reduced the\\r\\nestate of Lady Frances Pope to a fortune estimated at about £14,000, the\\r\\nlawyer proposed for her hand, and was accepted. After his marriage,\\r\\nalluding to his exertions in behalf of Lady Elizabeth Lee\\'s very\\r\\ndisputable claim, he used to say that \"he had been counsel against\\r\\nhimself;\" but Roger North frankly admits that \"if this question had not\\r\\ncome to such a composition, which diminished the ladies\\' fortunes, his\\r\\nbrother had never compassed his match.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not without reluctance that the Countess of Downs consented to\\r\\nthe union of her daughter with the lawyer who had half ruined her, and\\r\\nwho (though he was Solicitor General and in fine practice) could settle\\r\\nonly £5000 upon the lady. \"I well remember,\" observes Roger, \"the good\\r\\ncountess had some qualms, and complained that she knew not how she could\\r\\njustify what she had done (meaning the marrying her daughters with no\\r\\nbetter settlement).\" To these qualms Francis North, with lawyer-like\\r\\ncoolness, answered--\"Madam, if you meet with any question about that,\\r\\n_say_ that your daughter has £1000 per annum jointure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marriage was celebrated in Wroxton Church; and after bountiful\\r\\nrejoicings with certain loyalist families of Oxfordshire, the happy\\r\\ncouple went up to London and lived in chambers until they moved into a\\r\\nhouse in Chancery Lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may surprise some readers of this book to learn that George Jeffreys,\\r\\nthe odious judge of the Bloody Circuit, was a successful gallant. Tall,\\r\\nwell-shaped, and endowed by nature with a pleasant countenance and\\r\\nagreeable features, Jeffreys was one of the most fascinating men of his\\r\\ntime. A wit and a _bon-vivant_, he could hit the humor of the roystering\\r\\ncavaliers who surrounded the \\'merry monarch;\\' a man of gallantry and\\r\\npolite accomplishments, he was acceptable to women of society. The same\\r\\ntongue that bullied from the bench, when witnesses were perverse or\\r\\ncounsel unruly, could flatter with such melodious affectation of\\r\\nsincerity, that he was known as a most delightful companion. As a\\r\\nmusical connoisseur he spoke with authority; as a teller of good stories\\r\\nhe had no equal in town. Even those who detested him did not venture to\\r\\ndeny that in the discharge of his judicial offices he could at his\\r\\npleasure assume a dignity and urbane composure that well became the seat\\r\\nof justice. In short, his talents and graces were so various and\\r\\neffective, that he would have risen to the bench, even if he had labored\\r\\nunder the disadvantages of pure morality and amiable temper.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen declared him irresistible. At court he had the ear of Nell Gwyn\\r\\nand the Duchess of Portsmouth--the Protestant favorite and the Catholic\\r\\nmistress; and before he attained the privilege of entering Whitehall--at\\r\\na time when his creditors were urgent, and his best clients were the\\r\\ninferior attorneys of the city courts--he was loved by virtuous girls.\\r\\nHe was still poor, unknown, and struggling with difficulties, when he\\r\\ninduced an heiress to accept his suit,--the daughter of a rural squire\\r\\nwhose wine the barrister had drunk upon circuit. This young lady was\\r\\nwooed under circumstances of peculiar difficulty; and she promised to\\r\\nelope with him if her father refused to receive him as a son-in-law.\\r\\nIll-luck befell the scheme; and whilst young Jeffreys was waiting in\\r\\nthe Temple for the letter which should decide his movements, an\\r\\nintimation reached him that elopement was impossible and union\\r\\nforbidden. The bearer of this bad news was a young lady--the child of a\\r\\npoor clergyman--who had been the confidential friend and paid companion\\r\\nof the squire\\'s daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case was hard for Jeffreys, cruel for the fair messenger. He had\\r\\nlost an advantageous match, she had lost her daily bread. Furious with\\r\\nher for having acted as the _confidante_ of the clandestine lovers, the\\r\\nsquire had turned this poor girl out of his house; and she had come to\\r\\nLondon to seek for employment as well as to report the disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeffreys saw her overpowered with trouble and shame--penniless in the\\r\\ngreat city, and disgraced by expulsion from her patron\\'s roof. Seeing\\r\\nthat her abject plight was the consequence of amiable readiness to serve\\r\\nhim, Jeffreys pitied and consoled her. Most young men would have soothed\\r\\ntheir consciences and dried the running tears with a gift of money or a\\r\\nletter recommending the outcast to a new employer. As she was pretty, a\\r\\nlibertine would have tried to seduce her. In Jeffreys, compassion roused\\r\\na still finer sentiment: he loved the poor girl and married her. On May\\r\\n23, 1667, Sarah Neesham was married to George Jeffreys of the Inner\\r\\nTemple; and her father, in proof of his complete forgiveness of her\\r\\n_escapade_, gave her a fortune of £300--a sum which the poor clergyman\\r\\ncould not well afford to bestow on the newly married couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving outlived Sarah Neesham, Jeffreys married again--taking for his\\r\\nsecond wife a widow whose father was Sir Thomas Bludworth, ex-Lord Mayor\\r\\nof London. Whether rumor treated her unjustly it is impossible to say at\\r\\nthis distance of time; but if reliance may be put on many broad stories\\r\\ncurrent about the lady, her conduct was by no means free from fault. She\\r\\nwas reputed to entertain many lovers. Jeffreys would have created less\\r\\nscandal if, instead of taking her to his home, he had imitated the pious\\r\\nSir Matthew Hale, who married his maid-servant, and on being twitted by\\r\\nthe world with the lowliness of his choice, silenced his censors with a\\r\\njest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the love affairs of seventeenth-century lawyers place must be\\r\\nmade for mention of the second wife whom Chief Justice Bramston brought\\r\\nhome from Ireland, where she had outlived two husbands (the Bishop of\\r\\nClogher and Sir John Brereton), before she gave her hand to the judge\\r\\nwho had loved her in his boyhood. \"When I see her,\" says the Chief\\r\\nJustice\\'s son, who describes the expedition to Dublin, and the return to\\r\\nLondon, \"I confess I wondered at my father\\'s love. She was low, fatt,\\r\\nred-faced; her dress, too, was a hat and ruff, which tho\\' she never\\r\\nchanged to death. But my father, I believe, seeing me change\\r\\ncountenance, told me it was not beautie, but virtue, he courted. I\\r\\nbelieve she had been handsome in her youth; she had a delicate, fine\\r\\nhand, white and plump, and indeed proved a good wife and mother-in-law,\\r\\ntoo.\" On her journey to Charles I.\\'s London, this elderly bride, in her\\r\\nantiquated attire, rode from Holyhead to Beaumaris on a pillion behind\\r\\nher step-son. \"As she rode over the sandes,\" records her step-son,\\r\\n\"behind mee, and pulling off her gloves, her wedding ringe fell off, and\\r\\nsunk instantly. She caused her man to alight; she sate still behind me,\\r\\nand kept her eye on the place, and directed her man, but he not guessing\\r\\nwell, she leaped off, saying she would not stir without her ringe, it\\r\\nbeing the most unfortunate thinge that could befall any one to lose the\\r\\nwedding-ringe--made the man thrust his hand into the sands (the nature\\r\\nof which is not to bear any weight but passing), he pulled up sand, but\\r\\nnot the ringe. She made him strip his arme and put it deeper into the\\r\\nsand, and pulled up the ringe; and this done, he and shee, and all that\\r\\nstood still, were sunk almost to the knees, but we were all pleased that\\r\\nthe ringe was found.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the legal circle of Charles the Second\\'s London, Lady King was\\r\\nnotable as a virago whose shrill tongue disturbed her husband\\'s peace of\\r\\nmind by day, and broke his rest at night. Earning a larger income than\\r\\nany other barrister of his time, he had little leisure for domestic\\r\\nsociety; but the few hours which he could have spent with his wife and\\r\\nchildren, he usually preferred to spend in a tavern, beyond the reach of\\r\\nhis lady\\'s sharp querulousness. \"All his misfortune,\" says Roger North,\\r\\n\"lay at home, in perverse consort, who always, after his day-labor done,\\r\\nentertained him with all the chagrin and peevishness imaginable; so that\\r\\nhe went home as to his prison, or worse; and when the time came, rather\\r\\nthan go home, he chose commonly to get a friend to go and sit in a free\\r\\nchat at the tavern, over a single bottle, till twelve or one at night,\\r\\nand then to work again at five in the morning. His fatigue in business,\\r\\nwhich, as I said, was more than ordinary to him, and his no comfort, or\\r\\nrather, discomfort at home, and taking his refreshment by excising his\\r\\nsleep, soon pulled him down; so that, after a short illness, he died.\"\\r\\nOn his death-bed, however, he forgave the weeping woman, who, more\\r\\nthrough physical irritability than wicked design, had caused him so much\\r\\nundeserved discomfort; and by his last will and testament he made\\r\\nliberal provision for her wants. Having made his will, \"he said, I am\\r\\nglad it is done,\" runs the memoir of Sir John King, written by his\\r\\nfather, \"and after took leave of his wife, who was full of tears; seeing\\r\\nit is the will of God, let us part quietly in friendship, with\\r\\nsubmissiveness to his will, as we came together in friendship by His\\r\\nwill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"CICERO\" UPON HIS TRIAL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA complete history of the loves of lawyers would notice many scandalous\\r\\nintrigues and disreputable alliances, and would comprise a good deal of\\r\\nliterature for which the student would vainly look in the works of our\\r\\nbest authors. From the days of Wolsey, whose amours were notorious, and\\r\\nwhose illegitimate son became Dean of Wells, down to the present time of\\r\\nbrighter though not unimpeachable morality, the domestic lives of our\\r\\neminent judges and advocates have too frequently invited satire and\\r\\njustified regret. In the eighteenth century judges, without any loss of\\r\\n_caste_ or popular regard, openly maintained establishments that in\\r\\nthese more decorous and actually better days would cover their keepers\\r\\nwith obloquy. Attention could be directed to more than one legal family\\r\\nin which the descent must be traced through a succession of illegitimate\\r\\nbirths. Not only did eminent lawyers live openly with women who were not\\r\\ntheir wives, and with children whom the law declined to recognize as\\r\\ntheir offspring; but these women and children moved in good society,\\r\\napparently indifferent to shame that brought upon them but few\\r\\ninconveniences. In Great Ormond Street, where a mistress and several\\r\\nillegitimate children formed his family circle, Lord Thurlow was visited\\r\\nby bishops and deans; and it is said that in 1806, when Sir James\\r\\nMansfield, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was invited to the\\r\\nwoolsack and the peerage, he was induced to decline the offer more by\\r\\nconsideration for his illegitimate children than by fears for the\\r\\nstability of the new administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of Lord Thurlow\\'s undisguised intercourse with Mrs. Hervey,\\r\\nLord Campbell says, \"When I first knew the profession, it would not\\r\\nhave been endured that any one in a judicial situation should have had\\r\\nsuch a domestic establishment as Thurlow\\'s; but a majority of judges had\\r\\nmarried their mistresses. The understanding then was that a man elevated\\r\\nto the bench, if he had a mistress, must either marry her or put her\\r\\naway. For many years there has been no necessity for such an\\r\\nalternative.\" Either Lord Campbell had not the keen appetite for\\r\\nprofessional gossip, with which he is ordinarily credited, or his\\r\\nconscience must have pricked him when he wrote, \"For many years there\\r\\nhas been no necessity for such an alternative.\" To show how far his\\r\\nlordship erred through want of information or defect of candor is not\\r\\nthe duty of this page; but without making any statement that can wound\\r\\nprivate feeling, the present writer may observe that \\'the\\r\\nunderstanding,\\' to which Lord Campbell draws attention, has affected the\\r\\nfortune of ladies within the present generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the bright and high-minded Somers was the debauchee that Mrs.\\r\\nManley and Mr. Cooksey would have us believe him is incredible. It is\\r\\ndoubtful if Mackey in his \\'Sketch of Leading Characters at the English\\r\\nCourt\\' had sufficient reasons for clouding his sunny picture of the\\r\\nstatesman with the assertion that he was \"something of a libertine.\" But\\r\\nthere are occasions when prudence counsels us to pay attention to\\r\\nslander.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving raised himself to the office of Solicitor General, Somers, like\\r\\nFrancis Bacon, found an alderman\\'s daughter to his liking; and having\\r\\nformed a sincere attachment for her, he made his wishes known to her\\r\\nfather. Miss Anne Bawdon\\'s father was a wealthy merchant, styled Sir\\r\\nJohn Bawdon--a man proud of his civic station and riches, and thinking\\r\\nlightly of lawyers and law. When Somers stated his property and\\r\\nprojects, the rental of his small landed estate and the buoyancy of his\\r\\nprofessional income, the opulent knight by no means approved the\\r\\nprospect offered to his child. The lawyer might die in the course of\\r\\ntwelve months; in which case the Worcestershire estate would be still a\\r\\nsmall estate, and the professional income would cease. In twelve mouths\\r\\nMr. Solicitor might be proved a scoundrel, for at heart all lawyers were\\r\\narrant rogues; in which case matters would be still worse. Having\\r\\nregarded the question from these two points of view, Sir John Bawdon\\r\\ngave Somers his dismissal and married Miss Anne to a rich Turkey\\r\\nmerchant. Three years later, when Somers had risen to the woolsack, and\\r\\nit was clear that the rich Turkey merchant would never be anything\\r\\ngrander than a rich Turkey merchant, Sir John saw that he had made a\\r\\nserious blunder, for which his child certainly could not thank him. A\\r\\ngoodly list might be made of cases where papas have erred and repented\\r\\nin Sir John Bawdon\\'s fashion. Sir John Lawrence would have made his\\r\\ndaughter a Lord Keeper\\'s lady and a peeress, if he and his broker had\\r\\ndealt more liberally with Francis North. Had it not been for Sir Joseph\\r\\nJekyll\\'s counsel, Mr. Cocks, the Worcestershire squire, would have\\r\\nrejected Philip Yorke as an ineligible suitor, in which case _plain_\\r\\nMrs. Lygon would never have been Lady Hardwicke, and worked her\\r\\nhusband\\'s twenty purses of state upon curtains and hangings of crimson\\r\\nvelvet. And, if he were so inclined, this writer could point to a\\r\\nlearned judge, who in his days of \\'stuff\\' and \\'guinea fees\\' was deemed\\r\\nan ineligible match for a country apothecary\\'s pretty daughter. The\\r\\ncountry doctor being able to give his daughter £20,000, turned away\\r\\ndisdainfully from the unknown \\'junior,\\' who five years later was leading\\r\\nhis circuit, and quickly rose to the high office which he still fills to\\r\\nthe satisfaction of his country.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisappointed in his pursuit of Anne Bawdon, Somers never again made any\\r\\nwoman an offer of marriage; but scandalous gossip accused him of immoral\\r\\nintercourse with his housekeeper. This woman\\'s name was Blount; and\\r\\nwhile she resided with the Chancellor, fame whispered that her husband\\r\\nwas still living. Not only was Somers charged with open adultery, but it\\r\\nwas averred that for the sake of peace he had imprisoned in a madhouse\\r\\nhis mistress\\'s lawful husband, who was originally a Worcester tradesman.\\r\\nThe chief authority for this startling imputation is Mrs. Manley, who\\r\\nwas encouraged, if not actually paid, by Swift to lampoon his political\\r\\nadversaries. In her \\'New Atalantis\\'--the \\'Cicero\\' of which scandalous\\r\\nwork was understood by its readers to signify \\'Lord Somers,\\'--this\\r\\nshameless woman entertained quid-nuncs and women of fashion by putting\\r\\nthis abominable story in written words, the coarseness of which accorded\\r\\nwith the repulsiveness of the accusation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a time when honest writers on current politics were punished with\\r\\nfine and imprisonment, the pillory and the whip, statesmen and\\r\\necclesiastics were not ashamed to keep such libellers as Mrs. Manley in\\r\\ntheir pay. That the reader may fully appreciate the change which time\\r\\nhas wrought in the tone of political literature, let him contrast the\\r\\nvirulence and malignity of this unpleasant passage from the New\\r\\nAtalantis, with the tone which recently characterized the public\\r\\ndiscussion of the case which is generally known by the name of \\'The\\r\\nEdmunds Scandal.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding her notorious disregard of truth, it is scarcely\\r\\ncredible that Mrs. Manley\\'s scurrilous charge was in no way countenanced\\r\\nby facts. At the close of the seventeenth century to keep a mistress was\\r\\nscarcely regarded as an offence against good morals; and living in\\r\\naccordance with the fashion of the time, it is probable that Somers did\\r\\nthat which Lord Thurlow, after an interval of a century, was able to do\\r\\nwithout rousing public disapproval. Had his private life been spotless,\\r\\nhe would doubtless have taken legal steps to silence his traducer; and\\r\\nunsustained by a knowledge that he dared not court inquiry into his\\r\\ndomestic arrangements, Mrs. Manley would have used her pen with greater\\r\\ncaution. But all persons competent to form an opinion on the case have\\r\\nagreed that the more revolting charges of the indictment were the\\r\\nbaseless fictions of a malicious and unclean mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X.\\r\\n\\r\\nBROTHERS IN TROUBLE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the \\'Philosophical Dictionary,\\' Voltaire, laboring under\\r\\nmisapprehension or carried away by perverse humor, made the following\\r\\nstrange announcement:--\"Il est public en Angleterre, et on voudroit le\\r\\nnier en vain, que le Chancelier Cowper épousa deux femmes, qui vécurent\\r\\nensemble dans sa maison avec une concorde singulière qui fit honneur à\\r\\ntous trois. Plusieurs curieux ont encore le petit livre que ce\\r\\nChancelier composa en faveur de la Polygamie.\" Tickled by the\\r\\nextravagant credulity or grotesque malice of this declaration, an\\r\\nEnglish wit, improving upon the published words, represented the\\r\\nFrenchman as maintaining that the custodian of the Great Seal of England\\r\\nwas called the _Lord Keeper_, because, by English law, he was permitted\\r\\nto keep as many wives as he pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reader\\'s amusement will not be diminished by a brief statement of\\r\\nthe facts to which we are indebted for Voltaire\\'s assertions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Cowper, the first earl of his line, began life with a reputation\\r\\nfor dissipated tastes and habits, and by unpleasant experience he\\r\\nlearned how difficult it is to get rid of a bad name. The son of a\\r\\nHertfordshire baronet, he was still a law student when he formed a\\r\\nreprehensible connexion with an unmarried lady of that county--Miss (or,\\r\\nas she was called by the fashion of the day Mistress) Elizabeth Culling,\\r\\nof Hertingfordbury Park. But little is known of this woman. Her age is\\r\\nan affair of uncertainty, and all the minor circumstances of her\\r\\nintrigue with young William Cowper are open to doubt and conjecture; but\\r\\nthe few known facts justify the inference that she neither merited nor\\r\\nfound much pity in her disgrace, and that William erred through boyish\\r\\nindiscretion rather than from vicious propensity. She bore him two\\r\\nchildren, and he neither married her nor was required by public opinion\\r\\nto marry her. The respectability of their connexions gave the affair a\\r\\npeculiar interest, and afforded countenance to many groundless reports.\\r\\nBy her friends it was intimated that the boy had not triumphed over the\\r\\nlady\\'s virtue until he had made her a promise of marriage; and some\\r\\npersons even went so far as to assert that they were privately married.\\r\\nIt is not unlikely that at one time the boy intended to make her his\\r\\nwife as soon as he should be independent of his father, and free to\\r\\nplease himself. Beyond question, however, is it that they were never\\r\\nunited in wedlock, and that Will Cowper joined the Home Circuit with the\\r\\ntenacious fame of a scapegrace and _roué_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat he was for any long period a man of dissolute morals is improbable;\\r\\nfor he was only twenty-four years of age when he was called to the bar,\\r\\nand before his call he had married (after a year\\'s wooing) a virtuous\\r\\nand exemplary young lady, with whom he lived happily for more than\\r\\ntwenty years. A merchant\\'s child, whose face was her fortune--Judith,\\r\\nthe daughter of Sir Robert Booth, is extolled by biographers for\\r\\nreclaiming her young husband from a life of levity and culpable\\r\\npleasure. That he loved her sincerely from the date of their imprudent\\r\\nmarriage till the date of her death, which occurred just about six\\r\\nmonths before his elevation to the woolsack, there is abundant evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudith died April 2, 1705, and in the September of the following year\\r\\nthe Lord Keeper married Mary Clavering, the beautiful and virtuous lady\\r\\nof the bedchamber to Caroline Wilhelmina Dorothea, Princess of Wales.\\r\\nThis lady was the Countess Cowper whose diary was published by Mr.\\r\\nMurray in the spring of 1864; and in every relation of life she was as\\r\\ngood and noble a creature as her predecessor in William Cowper\\'s\\r\\naffection. Of the loving terms on which she lived with her lord,\\r\\nconclusive testimony is found in their published letters and her diary.\\r\\nFrequently separated by his professional avocations and her duties of\\r\\nattendance upon the Princess of Wales, they maintained, during the\\r\\nperiods of personal severance, a close and tender intercourse by written\\r\\nwords; and at all other times, in sickness not less than in health, they\\r\\nwere a fondly united couple. One pathetic entry in the countess\\'s diary\\r\\nspeaks eloquently of their nuptial tenderness and devotion:--\"April 7th,\\r\\n1716. After dinner we went to Sir Godfrey Kneller\\'s to see a picture of\\r\\nmy lord, which he is drawing, and is the best that was ever done for\\r\\nhim; it is for my drawing-room, and in the same posture that he watched\\r\\nme so many weeks in my great illness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Cowper\\'s second marriage was solemnized with a secrecy for which\\r\\nhis biographers are unable to account. The event took place September,\\r\\n1706, about two months before his father\\'s death, but it was not\\r\\nannounced till the end of February, 1707, at which time Luttrell entered\\r\\nin his diary, \"The Lord Keeper, who not long since was privately married\\r\\nto Mrs. Clavering of the bishoprick of Durham, brought her home this\\r\\nday.\" Mr. Foss, in his \\'Judges of England,\\' suggests that the\\r\\nconcealment of the union \"may not improbably be explained by the Lord\\r\\nKeeper\\'s desire not to disturb the last days of his father, who might\\r\\nperhaps have been disappointed that the selection had not fallen on some\\r\\nother lady to whom he had wished his son to be united.\" But this\\r\\nconjecture, notwithstanding its probability, is only a conjecture.\\r\\nUnless they had grave reasons for their conduct, the Lord Keeper and his\\r\\nlady had better have joined hands in the presence of the world, for the\\r\\nmystery of their private wedding nettled public curiosity, and gave new\\r\\nlife to an old slander.\\r\\n\\r\\nCowper\\'s boyish _escapade_ was not forgotten by the malicious. No sooner\\r\\nhad he become conspicuous in his profession and in politics, than the\\r\\nstory of his intercourse with Miss Culling was told in coffee-rooms with\\r\\nall the exaggerations that prurient fancy could devise or enmity\\r\\ndictate. The old tale of a secret marriage--or, still worse, of a mock\\r\\nmarriage--was caught from the lips of some Hertford scandal-monger, and\\r\\nconveyed to the taverns and drawing-rooms of London. In taking Sir\\r\\nRobert Booth\\'s daughter to Church, he was said to have committed bigamy.\\r\\nEven while he was in the House of Commons he was known by the name of\\r\\n\\'Will Bigamy;\\' and that _sobriquet_ clung to him ever afterwards. Twenty\\r\\nyears of wholesome domestic intercourse with his first wife did not free\\r\\nhim from the abominable imputation, and his marriage with Miss Clavering\\r\\nrevived the calumny in a new form. Fools were found to believe that he\\r\\nhad married her during Judith Booth\\'s life and that their union had been\\r\\nconcealed for several years instead of a few months. The affair with\\r\\nMiss Culling was for a time forgotten, and the charge preferred against\\r\\nthe keeper of the queen\\'s conscience was bigamy of a much more recent\\r\\ndate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn various forms this ridiculous accusation enlivens the squibs of the\\r\\npamphleteers of Queen Anne\\'s reign. In the \\'New Atalantis\\' Mrs. Manley\\r\\ncertified that the fair victim was first persuaded by his lordship\\'s\\r\\nsophistries to regard polygamy as accordant with moral law. Having thus\\r\\npoisoned her understanding, he gratified her with a form of marriage, in\\r\\nwhich his brother Spencer, in clerical disguise, acted the part of a\\r\\npriest. It was even suggested that the bride in this mock marriage was\\r\\nthe lawyer\\'s ward. Never squeamish about the truth, when he could gain a\\r\\npoint by falsehood, Swift endorsed the spiteful fabrication, and in the\\r\\n_Examiner_, pointing at Lord Cowper, wrote--\"This gentleman, knowing\\r\\nthat marriage fees were a considerable perquisite to the clergy, found\\r\\nout a way of improving them cent. per cent. for the benefit of the\\r\\nChurch. His invention was to marry a second wife while the first was\\r\\nalive; convincing her of the lawfulness by such arguments as he did not\\r\\ndoubt would make others follow the same example. _These he had drawn up\\r\\nin writing with intention to publish for the general good, and it is\\r\\nhoped he may now have leisure to finish them._\" It is possible that the\\r\\nwords in italics were the cause of Voltaire\\'s astounding statement:\\r\\n\"Plusieurs curieux ont encore le petit livre que ce Chancelier composa\\r\\nen faveur de la Polygamie.\" On this point Lord Campbell, confidently\\r\\nadvancing an opinion which can scarcely command unanimous assent, says,\\r\\n\"The fable of the \\'_Treatise_\\' is evidently taken from the panegyric on\\r\\n\\'a plurality of wives,\\' which Mrs. Manley puts into the mouth of Lord\\r\\nCowper, in a speech supposed to be addressed by Hernando to Lousia.\" But\\r\\nwhether Voltaire accepted the \\'New Atalantis,\\' or the _Examiner_, as an\\r\\nauthority for the statements of his very laughable passage, it is\\r\\nscarcely credible that he believed himself to be penning the truth. The\\r\\nmost reasonable explanation of the matter appears to be, that tickled\\r\\nby Swift\\'s venomous lines, the sarcastic Frenchman in malice and gaiety\\r\\nadopted them, and added to their piquancy by the assurance that the\\r\\nChancellor\\'s book was not only published, but was preserved by\\r\\nconnoisseurs as a literary curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike his elder brother, the Chancellor, Spencer Cowper married at an\\r\\nearly age, lived to wed a second wife, and was accused of immorality\\r\\nthat was foreign to his nature. The offence with which the younger\\r\\nCowper was charged, created so wide and profound a sensation, and gave\\r\\nrise to such a memorable trial, that the reader will like to glance at\\r\\nthe facts of the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in 1669, Spencer Cowper was scarcely of age when he was called to\\r\\nthe bar, and made Comptroller of the Bridge House Estate. The office,\\r\\nwhich was in the gift of the corporation of London, provided him with a\\r\\ngood income, together with a residence in the Bridge House, St. Olave\\'s,\\r\\nSouthwark, and brought him in contact with men who were able to bring\\r\\nhim briefs or recommend him to attorneys. For several years the\\r\\nboy-barrister was thought a singularly lucky fellow. His hospitable\\r\\nhouse was brightened by a young and lovely wife (Pennington, the\\r\\ndaughter of John Goodeve), and he was so much respected in his locality\\r\\nthat he was made a justice of the peace. In his profession he was\\r\\nequally fortunate: his voice was often heard at Westminster and on the\\r\\nHome Circuit, the same circuit where his brother William practised and\\r\\nhis family interest lay. He found many clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvy is the shadow of success; and the Cowpers were watched by men who\\r\\nlonged to ruin them. From the day when they armed and rode forth to\\r\\nwelcome the Prince of Orange, the lads had been notably fortunate.\\r\\nNotwithstanding his reputation for immorality William Cowper had sprung\\r\\ninto lucrative practice, and in 1695 was returned to Parliament as\\r\\nrepresentative for Hartford, the other seat for the borough being filled\\r\\nby his father, Sir William Cowper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of their comeliness and complaisant manners, the lightness of\\r\\ntheir wit and the _prestige_ of their success, Hertford heard murmurs\\r\\nthat the young Cowpers were _too_ lucky by half, and that the Cowper\\r\\ninterest was dangerously powerful in the borough. It was averred that\\r\\nthe Cowpers were making unfair capital out of liberal professions: and\\r\\nwhen the Hertford Whigs sent the father and son to the House of Commons,\\r\\nthe vanquished party cursed in a breath the Dutch usurper and his\\r\\nobsequious followers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was resolved to damage the Cowpers:--by fair means or foul, to render\\r\\nthem odious in their native town.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre long the malcontents found a good cry.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely less odious to the Hertford Tories than the Cowpers themselves\\r\\nwas an influential Quaker of the town, named Stout, who actively\\r\\nsupported the Cowper interest. A man of wealth and good repute, this\\r\\nfollower of George Fox exerted himself enthusiastically in the election\\r\\ncontest of 1695: and in acknowledgment of his services the Cowpers\\r\\nhonored him with their personal friendship. Sir William Cowper asked him\\r\\nto dine at Hertford Castle--the baronet\\'s country residence; Sir\\r\\nWilliam\\'s sons made calls on his wife and daughter. Of course these\\r\\nattentions from Cowpers to \\'the Shaker\\' were offensive to the Tory\\r\\nmagnates of the place: and they vented their indignation in whispers,\\r\\nthat the young men never entered Stout\\'s house without kissing his\\r\\npretty daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these rumors were still young, Mr. Stout died leaving considerable\\r\\nproperty to his widow, and to his only child--the beauteous Sarah; and\\r\\nafter his death the intercourse between the two families became yet more\\r\\nclose and cordial. The lawyers advised the two ladies about the\\r\\nmanagement of their property: and the baronet gave them invitations to\\r\\nhis London House in Hatton Garden, as well as to Hertford Castle. The\\r\\nfriendship had disastrous consequences. Both the brothers were very\\r\\nfascinating men--men, moreover, who not only excelled in the art of\\r\\npleasing, but who also habitually exercised it. From custom,\\r\\ninclination, policy, they were very kind to the mother and daughter;\\r\\nprobably paying the latter many compliments which they would never have\\r\\nuttered had they been single men. Coming from an unmarried man the\\r\\nspeech is often significant of love, which on the lips of a husband is\\r\\nbut the language of courtesy. But, unfortunately, Miss (\\'Mistress\\' is\\r\\nher style in the report of a famous trial) Sarah Stout fell madly in\\r\\nlove with Spencer Cowper notwithstanding the impossibility of marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only did she conceive a dangerous fondness for him, but she openly\\r\\nexpressed it--by speech and letters. She visited him in the Temple, and\\r\\npersecuted him with her embarrassing devotion whenever he came to\\r\\nHertford. It was a trying position for a young man not thirty years of\\r\\nage, with a wife to whom he was devotedly attached, and a family whose\\r\\npolitical influence in his native town might be hurt by publication of\\r\\nthe girl\\'s folly. Taking his elder brother into his confidence, he asked\\r\\nwhat course he ought to pursue. To withdraw totally and abruptly from\\r\\nthe two ladies, would be cruel to the daughter, insulting to the mother;\\r\\nmoreover, it would give rise to unpleasant suspicions and prejudicial\\r\\ngossip in the borough. It was decided that Spencer must repress the\\r\\ngirl\\'s advances--must see her loss frequently--and, by a reserved and\\r\\nfrigid manner, must compel her to assume an appearance of womanly\\r\\ndiscretion. But the plan failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the opening of the year 1699 she invited him to take up his quarters\\r\\nin her mother\\'s house, when he came to Hertford at the next Spring\\r\\nAssizes. This invitation he declined, saying that he had arranged to\\r\\ntake his brother\\'s customary lodgings in the house of Mr. Barefoot, in\\r\\nthe Market Place, but with manly consideration he promised to call upon\\r\\nher. \"I am glad,\" Sarah wrote to him on March 5, 1699, \"you have not\\r\\nquite forgot there is such a person as I in being: but I am willing to\\r\\nshut my eyes and not see anything that looks like unkindness in you, and\\r\\nrather content myself with what excuses you are pleased to make, than be\\r\\ninquisitive into what I must not know: I am sure the winter has been too\\r\\nunpleasant for me to desire the continuance of it: and I wish you were\\r\\nto endure the sharpness of it but for one short hour, as I have done for\\r\\nmany long nights and days, and then I believe it would move that rocky\\r\\nheart of yours that can be so thoughtless of me as you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday, March 13, following the date of the words just quoted,\\r\\nSpencer Cowper rode into Hertford, alighted at Mrs. Stout\\'s house, and\\r\\ndined with the ladies. Having left the house after dinner, in order that\\r\\nhe might attend to some business, he returned in the evening and supped\\r\\nwith the two women. Supper over, Mrs. Stout retired for the night,\\r\\nleaving her daughter and the young barrister together. No sooner had the\\r\\nmother left the room, than a distressing scene ensued.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnable to control or soothe her, Spencer gently divided the clasp of her\\r\\nhands, and having freed himself from her embrace, hastened from the room\\r\\nand abruptly left the house. He slept at his lodgings; and the next\\r\\nmorning he was horror-struck on hearing that Sarah Stout\\'s body had been\\r\\nfound drowned in the mill-stream behind her old home. That catastrophe\\r\\nhad actually occurred. Scarcely had the young barrister reached the\\r\\nMarket Place, when the miserable girl threw herself into the stream from\\r\\nwhich her lifeless body was picked on the following morning. At the\\r\\ncoroner\\'s inquest which ensued, Spencer Cowper gave his evidence with\\r\\nextreme caution, withholding every fact that could be injurious to\\r\\nSarah\\'s reputation; and the jury returned a verdict that the deceased\\r\\ngentlewoman had killed herself whilst in a state of insanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn deep dejection Spencer Cowper continued the journey of the circuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the excitement of the public was not allayed by the inquest and\\r\\nsubsequent funeral. It was rumored that it was no case of self-murder,\\r\\nbut a case of murder by the barrister, who had strangled his dishonored\\r\\nvictim, and had then thrown her into the river. Anxious to save their\\r\\nsect from the stigma of suicide the Quakers concurred with the Tories in\\r\\ncharging the young man with a hideous complication of crimes. The case\\r\\nagainst Spencer was laid before Chief Justice Holt, who at first\\r\\ndismissed the accusation as absurd, but was afterwards induced to commit\\r\\nthe suspected man for trial; and in the July of 1699 the charge actually\\r\\ncame before a jury at the Hertford Assizes. Four prisoners--Spencer\\r\\nCowper, two attorneys, and a law-writer--were placed in the dock on the\\r\\ncharge of murdering Sarah Stout.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the present occasion there is no need to recapitulate the ridiculous\\r\\nevidence and absurd misconduct of the prosecution in this trial; though\\r\\ncriminal lawyers who wish to know what unfairness and irregularities\\r\\nwere permitted in such inquiries in the seventeenth century cannot do\\r\\nbetter than to peruse the full report of the proceedings, which may be\\r\\nfound in every comprehensive legal library. In this place it is enough\\r\\nto say that though the accusation was not sustained by a shadow of\\r\\nlegal testimony, the prejudice against the prisoners, both on the part\\r\\nof a certain section of the Hertford residents and the presiding judge,\\r\\nMr. Baron Hatsel, was such that the verdict for acquittal was a\\r\\ndisappointment to many who heard it proclaimed by the foreman of the\\r\\njury. Narcissus Luttrell, indeed, says that the verdict was \"to the\\r\\nsatisfaction of the auditors;\" but in this statement the diarist was\\r\\nunquestionably wrong, so far as the promoters of the prosecution were\\r\\nconcerned. Instead of accepting the decision without demur, they\\r\\nattempted to put the prisoners again on their trial by the obsolete\\r\\nprocess of \"appeal of murder;\" but this endeavor proving abortive, the\\r\\ncase was disposed of, and the prisoners\\' minds set at rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe barrister who was thus tried on a capital charge, and narrowly\\r\\nescaped a sentence that would have consigned him to an ignominious\\r\\ndeath, resumed his practice in the law courts, sat in the House of\\r\\nCommons and rose to be a judge in the Court of Common Pleas. It is said\\r\\nthat he \"presided on many trials for murder; ever cautious and\\r\\nmercifully inclined--remembering the great peril which he himself had\\r\\nundergone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same writer who aspersed Somers with her unchaste thoughts, and\\r\\nreiterated the charge of bigamy against Lord Chancellor Cowper, did not\\r\\nomit to give a false and malicious version to the incidents which had\\r\\nacutely wounded the fine sensibilities of the younger Cowper. But enough\\r\\nnotice has been taken of the \\'New Atalantis\\' in this chapter. To that\\r\\nrepulsive book we refer those readers who may wish to peruse Mrs.\\r\\nManley\\'s account of Sarah Stout\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nA distorted tradition of Sarah Stout\\'s tragic end, and of Lord Cowper\\'s\\r\\nimputed bigamy, was contributed to an early number of the \\'European\\' by\\r\\na clerical authority--the Rev. J. Hinton, Rector of Alderton, in\\r\\nNorthamptonshire. \"Mrs. Sarah Stout,\" says the writer, \"whose death was\\r\\ncharged upon Spencer Cowper, was strangled accidentally by drawing the\\r\\nsteenkirk too tight upon her neck, as she, with four or five young\\r\\npersons, were at a game of romp upon the staircase; but it was not done\\r\\nby Mr. Cowper, though one of the company. Mrs. Clavering, Lord\\r\\nChancellor Cowper\\'s second wife, whom he married during the life of his\\r\\nfirst, was there too; they were so confounded with the accident, that\\r\\nthey foolishly resolved to throw her into the water, thinking it would\\r\\npass that she had drowned herself.\" This charming paragraph illustrates\\r\\nthe vitality of scandal, and at the same time shows how ludicrously\\r\\nrumor and tradition mistell stories in the face of evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpencer Cowper\\'s second son, the Rev. John Cowper, D.D., was the father\\r\\nof William Cowper, the poet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI.\\r\\n\\r\\nEARLY MARRIAGES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding his illustrious descent, Simon Harcourt raised himself\\r\\nto the woolsack by his own exertions, and was in no degree indebted to\\r\\npowerful relatives for his elevation. The son of a knight, whose loyalty\\r\\nto the House of Stuart had impoverished his estate, he spent his\\r\\nstudent-days at Pembroke, Oxford, and the Inner Temple, in resolute\\r\\nlabor, and with few indulgences. His father could make him but a slender\\r\\nallowance; and when he assumed the gown of a barrister, the future\\r\\nChancellor, like Erskine in after years, was spurred to industry by the\\r\\nvoices of his wife and children. Whilst he was still an undergraduate of\\r\\nthe university, he fell in love with Rebecca Clark, daughter of a pious\\r\\nman, of whose vocation the modern peerages are ashamed. Sir Philip\\r\\nHarcourt (the Chancellor\\'s father) in spite of his loyalty quarrelled\\r\\nwith the Established Church, and joined the Presbyterians: and Thomas\\r\\nClark was his Presbyterian chaplain, secretary, and confidential\\r\\nservant. Great was Sir Philip\\'s wrath on learning that his boy had not\\r\\nonly fallen in love with Rebecca Clark, but had married her privately.\\r\\nIt is probable that the event lowered the worthy knight\\'s esteem for the\\r\\nPresbyterian system; but as anger could not cut the nuptial bond, the\\r\\nfather relented--gave the young people all the assistance he could, and\\r\\nhoped that they would live long without repenting their folly. The match\\r\\nturned out far better than the old knight feared. Taking his humble\\r\\nbride to modest chambers, young Harcourt applied sedulously to the study\\r\\nof the law; and his industry was rewarded by success, and by the\\r\\ngratitude of a dutiful wife. In unbroken happiness they lived together\\r\\nfor a succession of years, and their union was fruitful of children.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarcourt fared better with his love-match than Sergeant Hill with his\\r\\nheiress, Miss Medlycott of Cottingham, Northamptonshire. On the morning\\r\\nof his wedding the eccentric sergeant, having altogether forgotten his\\r\\nmost important engagement for the day, received his clients in chambers\\r\\nafter his usual practice, and remained busy with professional cares\\r\\nuntil a band of devoted friends forcibly carried him to the church,\\r\\nwhere his bride had been waiting for him more than an hour. The ceremony\\r\\nhaving been duly performed, he hastened back to his chambers, to be\\r\\npresent at a consultation. Notwithstanding her sincere affection for\\r\\nhim, the lady proved but an indifferent wife to the black-letter lawyer.\\r\\nEmpowered by Act of Parliament to retain her maiden-name after\\r\\nmarriage, she showed her disesteem for her husband\\'s patronymic by her\\r\\nmode of exercising the privilege secured to her by special law; and many\\r\\na time the sergeant indignantly insisted that she should use his name in\\r\\nher signatures. \"My name is Hill, madam; my father\\'s name was Hill,\\r\\nmadam; all the Hills have been named Hill, madam; Hill is a good\\r\\nname--and by ----, madam, you _shall_ use it.\" On other matters he was\\r\\nmore compliant--humoring her old-maidish fancies in a most docile and\\r\\nconciliating manner. Curiously neat and orderly, Mrs. Medlycott took\\r\\ngreat pride in the faultlessness of her domestic arrangements, so far as\\r\\ncleanliness and precise order were concerned. To maintain the whiteness\\r\\nof the pipe-clayed steps before the front door of her Bedford Square\\r\\nmansion was a chief object of her existence; and to gratify her in this\\r\\nparticular, Sergeant Hill use daily to leave his premises by the kitchen\\r\\nsteps. Having outlived the lady, Hill observed to a friend who was\\r\\ncondoling with him on his recent bereavement, \"Ay, my poor wife is gone!\\r\\nShe was a good sort of woman--in _her_ way a _very_ good sort of woman.\\r\\nI do honestly declare my belief that in _her_ way she had no equal.\\r\\nBut--but--I\\'ll tell you something in confidence. If ever I marry again,\\r\\n_I won\\'t marry merely for money_.\" The learned sergeant died in his\\r\\nninety-third year without having made a second marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Harcourt, John Scott married under circumstances that called forth\\r\\nmany warm expressions of censure; and like Harcourt, he, in after life,\\r\\nreflected on his imprudent marriage as one of the most fortunate steps\\r\\nof his earlier career. The romance of the law contains few more pleasant\\r\\nepisodes than the story of handsome Jack Scott\\'s elopement with Bessie\\r\\nSurtees. There is no need to tell in detail how the comely Oxford\\r\\nscholar danced with the banker\\'s daughter at the Newcastle assemblies;\\r\\nhow his suit was at first recognised by the girl\\'s parents, although the\\r\\nScotts were but rich \\'fitters,\\' whereas Aubone Surtees, Esquire, was a\\r\\nbanker and gentleman of honorable descent; how, on the appearance of an\\r\\naged and patrician suitor for Bessie\\'s hand, papa and mamma told Jack\\r\\nScott not to presume on their condescension, and counseled Bessie to\\r\\nthrow her lover over and become the lady of Sir William Blackett; how\\r\\nBessie was faithful, and Jack was urgent; how they had secret interviews\\r\\non Tyne-side and in London, meeting clandestinely on horseback and on\\r\\nfoot, corresponding privately by letters and confidential messengers;\\r\\nhow, eventually, the lovers, to the consternation of \\'good society\\' in\\r\\nNewcastle, were made husband and wife at Blackshiels, North Britain. Who\\r\\nis ignorant of the story? Does not every visitor to Newcastle pause\\r\\nbefore an old house in Sandhill, and look up at the blue pane which\\r\\nmarks the window from which Bessie descended into her lover\\'s arms?\\r\\n\\r\\nJack and Bessie were not punished with even that brief period of\\r\\nsuffering and uncertainty which conscientious novelists are accustomed,\\r\\nfor the sake of social morals, to assign to run-away lovers before the\\r\\nmerciful guardian or tender parent promises forgiveness and a liberal\\r\\nallowance, paid in quarterly installments. In his old age Eldon used to\\r\\nmaintain that their plight was very pitiable on the third morning after\\r\\ntheir rash union. \"Our funds were exhausted: we had not a home to go to,\\r\\nand we knew not whether our friends would ever speak to us again.\" In\\r\\nthis strain ran the veteran\\'s story, which, like all other anecdotes\\r\\nfrom the same source, must be received with caution. But even the old\\r\\npeer, ever ready to exaggerate his early difficulties, had not enough\\r\\neffrontery to represent that their dejection lasted more than three\\r\\ndays. The fathers of the bride and bridegroom soon met and came to\\r\\nterms, and with the beginning of the new year Bessie Scott was living in\\r\\nNew Inn Hall, Oxford, whilst her husband read Vinerian Lectures, and\\r\\npresided over that scholastic house. The position of Scott at this time\\r\\nwas very singular. He was acting as substitute for Sir Robert Chambers,\\r\\nthe principal of New Inn Hall and Vinerian Professor of Law, who\\r\\ncontrived to hold his university preferments, whilst he discharged the\\r\\nduties of a judge in India. To give an honest color to this indefensible\\r\\narrangement, it was provided that the lectures read from the Vinerian\\r\\nChair should actually be written by the Professor, although they were\\r\\ndelivered by deputy. Scott, therefore, as the Professor\\'s mouth-piece,\\r\\non a salary of £60 a year, with free quarters in the Principal\\'s house,\\r\\nwas merely required to read a series of treatises sent to him by the\\r\\nabsent teacher. \"The law-professor,\" the ex-Chancellor used to relate\\r\\nwith true Eldonian humor and _fancy_--\"sent me the first lecture, which\\r\\nI had to read immediately to the students, and which I began without\\r\\nknowing a single word that was in it. It was upon the statute (4 and 5\\r\\nP. and M. c. 8), \\'of young men running away with maidens.\\' Fancy me\\r\\nreading, with about 140 boys and young men all giggling at the\\r\\nProfessor! Such a tittering audience no one ever had.\" If this incident\\r\\nreally occurred on the occasion of his \\'first reading,\\' the laughter\\r\\nmust have been inextinguishable; for, of course, Jack Scott\\'s run-away\\r\\nmarriage had made much gossip in Oxford Common Rooms, and the singular\\r\\nloveliness of his girlish wife (described by an eye-witness as being \"so\\r\\nvery young as to give the impression of childhood,\") stirred the heart\\r\\nof every undergraduate who met her in High Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no harm done by laughter at the old Chancellor\\'s romantic\\r\\nfictions about the poverty which he and his Bessie encountered, hand in\\r\\nhand, at the outset of life; for the laughter blinds no one to the\\r\\ngenuine affection and wholesome honesty of the young husband and wife.\\r\\nOne has reason to wish that marriages such as theirs were more frequent\\r\\namongst lawyers in these ostentatious days. At present the young\\r\\nbarrister, who marries before he has a clear fifteen hundred a year, is\\r\\ncharged with reckless imprudence; and unless his wife is a woman of\\r\\nfortune, or he is able to settle a heavy sum of money upon her, his\\r\\nanxious friends terrify him with pictures of want and sorrow stored up\\r\\nfor him in the future. Society will not let him live after the fashion\\r\\nof \\'juniors\\' eighty or a hundred years since. He must maintain two\\r\\nestablishments--his chambers for business, his house in the west-end of\\r\\ntown for his wife. Moreover, the lady must have a brougham and liberal\\r\\npin money, or four or five domestic servants and a drawing-room well\\r\\nfurnished with works of art and costly decorations. They must give state\\r\\ndinners and three or four routs every season; and in all other matters\\r\\ntheir mode of life must be, or seem to be, that of the upper ten\\r\\nthousand. Either they must live in this style, or be pushed aside and\\r\\nforgotten. The choice for them lies between very expensive society or\\r\\nnone at all--that is to say, none at all amongst the rising members of\\r\\nthe legal profession, and the sort of people with whom young barristers,\\r\\nfrom prudential motives, wish to form acquaintance. Doubtless many a\\r\\nfair reader of this page is already smiling at the writer\\'s simplicity,\\r\\nand is saying to herself, \"Here is one of the advocates of marriage on\\r\\nthree hundred a year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this writer is not going to advocate marriage on that or any other\\r\\nparticular sum. From personal experience he knows what comfort a married\\r\\nman may have for an outlay of three or four hundred per annum; and from\\r\\npersonal observation he knows what privations and ignominious poverty\\r\\nare endured by unmarried men who spend twice the larger of those sums\\r\\non chamber-and-club life. He knows that there are men who shiver at the\\r\\nbare thought of losing caste by marriage with a portionless girl, whilst\\r\\nthey are complacently leading the life which, in nine cases out of ten,\\r\\nterminates in the worst form of social degradation--matrimony where the\\r\\nhusband blushes for his wife\\'s early history, and dares not tell his own\\r\\nchildren the date of his marriage certificate. If it were his pleasure\\r\\nhe could speak sad truths about the bachelor of modest income, who is\\r\\nrich enough to keep his name on the books of two fashionable clubs, to\\r\\nlive in a good quarter of London, and to visit annually continental\\r\\ncapitals, but far too poor to think of incurring the responsibilities of\\r\\nmarriage. It could be demonstrated that in a great majority of instances\\r\\nthis wary, prudent, selfish gentleman, instead of being the social\\r\\nsuccess which many simple people believe him, is a signal and most\\r\\nmiserable failure; that instead of pursuing a career of various\\r\\nenjoyments and keen excitements, he is a martyr to _ennui_, bored by the\\r\\nmonotony of an objectless existence, utterly weary of the splendid\\r\\nclubs, in which he is presumed by unsophisticated admirers to find an\\r\\nample compensation for want of household comfort and domestic affection:\\r\\nthat as soon as he has numbered forty years, he finds the roll of his\\r\\nfriends and cordial acquaintances diminish, and is compelled to retire\\r\\nbefore younger men, who snatch from his grasp the prizes of social\\r\\nrivalry; and that, as each succeeding lustre passes, he finds the chain\\r\\nof his secret disappointments and embarrassments more galling and heavy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not a question of marriage on three hundred a year without\\r\\nprospects, but a marriage on five or six hundred a year with good\\r\\nexpectations. In the Inns of Court there are, at the present time,\\r\\nscores of clever, industrious fine-hearted gentlemen who have sure\\r\\nincomes of three or four hundred pounds per annum. In Tyburnia and\\r\\nKensington there is an equal number of young gentlewomen with incomes\\r\\nvarying between £150 and £300 a year. These men and women see each other\\r\\nat balls and dinners, in the parks and at theatres; the ladies would not\\r\\ndislike to be wives, the men are longing to be husbands. But that\\r\\nhideous tyrant, social opinion, bids them avoid marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Lord Eldon\\'s time the case was otherwise. Society saw nothing\\r\\nsingular or reprehensible in his conduct when he brought Bessie to live\\r\\nin the little house in Cursitor Street. No one sneered at the young\\r\\nlaw-student, whose home was a little den in a dingy thoroughfare. At a\\r\\nlater date, the rising junior, whose wife lived over his business\\r\\nchambers in Carey Street, was the object of no unkind criticism because\\r\\nhis domestic arrangements were inexpensive, and almost frugal. Had his\\r\\nsuccess been tardy instead of quick and decisive, and had circumstances\\r\\ncompelled him to live under the shadow of Lincoln\\'s Inn wall for thirty\\r\\nyears on a narrow income, he would not on that account have suffered\\r\\nfrom a single disparaging criticism. Amongst his neighbors in adjacent\\r\\nstreets, and within the boundaries of his Inn, he would have found\\r\\nsociety for himself and wife, and playmates for his children. Good\\r\\nfortune coming in full strong flood, he was not compelled to greatly\\r\\nchange his plan of existence. Even in those days, when costly\\r\\nostentation characterized aristocratic society--he was permitted to live\\r\\nmodestly--and lay the foundation of that great property which he\\r\\ntransmitted to his ennobled descendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen satire has done its worst with the miserly propensities of the\\r\\ngreat lawyer and his wife, their long familiar intercourse exhibits a\\r\\nwealth of fine human affection and genuine poetry which sarcasm cannot\\r\\ntouch. Often as he had occasion to regret Lady Eldon\\'s peculiarities--the\\r\\nstinginess which made her grudge the money paid for a fish or a basket of\\r\\nfruit; the nervous repugnance to society, which greatly diminished his\\r\\npopularity; and the taste for solitude and silence which marked her\\r\\npainfully towards the close of her life--the Chancellor never even hinted\\r\\nto her his dissatisfaction. When their eldest daughter, following her\\r\\nmother\\'s example, married without the permission of her parents, it was\\r\\nsuggested to Lord Eldon that her ladyship ought to take better care of\\r\\nher younger daughter, Lady Frances, and entering society should play the\\r\\npart of a vigilant _chaperon_. The counsel was judicious; but the\\r\\nChancellor declined to act upon it, saying,--\"When she was young and\\r\\nbeautiful, she gave up everything for me. What she is, I have made her;\\r\\nand I cannot now bring myself to compel her inclinations. Our marriage\\r\\nprevented her mixing in society when it afforded her pleasure; it\\r\\nappears to give pain now, and why should I interpose?\" In his old age,\\r\\nwhen she was dead, he visited his estate in Durham, but could not\\r\\nfind heart to cross the Tyne bridge and look at the old house from\\r\\nwhich he took her in the bloom and tenderness of her girlhood. An\\r\\nurgent invitation to visit Newcastle drew from him the reply--\"I\\r\\nknow my fellow-townsmen complain of my not coming to see them; but\\r\\n_how can I pass that bridge?_\" After a pause, he added, \"Poor Bessie!\\r\\nif ever there was an angel on earth she was one. The only reparation\\r\\nwhich one man can make to another for running away with his daughter,\\r\\nis to be exemplary in his conduct towards her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pecuniary affairs not less prudent than his brother, Lord Stowell in\\r\\nmatters of sentiment was capable of indiscretion. In the long list of\\r\\nlegal loves there are not many episodes more truly ridiculous than the\\r\\nstory of the older Scott\\'s second marriage. On April 10, 1813, the\\r\\ndecorous Sir William Scott, and Louisa Catharine, widow of John,\\r\\nMarquis of Sligo, and daughter of Admiral Lord Howe, were united in the\\r\\nbonds of holy wedlock, to the infinite amusement of the world of\\r\\nfashion, and to the speedy humiliation of the bridegroom. So incensed\\r\\nwas Lord Eldon at his brother\\'s folly, that he refused to appear at the\\r\\nwedding; and certainly the Chancellor\\'s displeasure was not without\\r\\nreason, for the notorious absurdity of the affair brought ridicule on\\r\\nthe whole of the Scott family connexion. The happy couple met for the\\r\\nfirst time in the Old Bailey, when Sir William Scott and Lord\\r\\nEllenborough presided at the trial of the marchioness\\'s son, the young\\r\\nMarquis of Sligo, who had incurred the anger of the law by luring into\\r\\nhis yacht, in Mediterranean waters, two of the king\\'s seamen. Throughout\\r\\nthe hearing of that _cause célèbre_, the marchioness sat in the fetid\\r\\ncourt of the Old Bailey, in the hope that her presence might rouse\\r\\namongst the jury or in the bench feelings favorable to her son. This\\r\\nhope was disappointed. The verdict having been given against the young\\r\\npeer, he was ordered to pay a fine of £5000, and undergo four months\\'\\r\\nincarceration in Newgate, and--worse than fine and imprisonment--was\\r\\ncompelled to listen to a parental address from Sir William Scott on the\\r\\nduties and responsibilities of men of high station. Either under the\\r\\ninfluence of sincere admiration for the judge, or impelled by desire for\\r\\nvengeance on the man who had presumed to lecture her son in a court of\\r\\njustice, the marchioness wrote a few hasty words of thanks to Sir\\r\\nWilliam Scott for his salutary exhortation to her boy. She even went so\\r\\nfar as to say that she wished the erring marquis could always have so\\r\\nwise a counsellor at his side. This communication was made upon a slip\\r\\nof paper, which the writer sent to the judge by an usher of the court.\\r\\nSir William read the note as he sat on the bench, and having looked\\r\\ntowards the fair scribe, he received from her a glance and smile that\\r\\nwere fruitful of much misery to him. Within four months the courteous\\r\\nSir William Scott was tied fast to a beautiful, shrill, voluble\\r\\ntermagant, who exercised marvellous ingenuity in rendering him wretched\\r\\nand contemptible. Reared in a stately school of old-world politeness,\\r\\nthe unhappy man was a model of decorum and urbanity. He took reasonable\\r\\npride in the perfection of his tone and manner; and the\\r\\nmarchioness--whose malice did not lack cleverness--was never more happy\\r\\nthan when she was gravely expostulating with him, in the presence of\\r\\nnumerous auditors, on his lamentable want of style, tact, and\\r\\ngentlemanlike bearing. It is said that, like Coke and Holt under similar\\r\\ncircumstances, Sir William preferred the quietude of his chambers to the\\r\\nsociety of an unruly wife, and that in the cellar of his Inn he sought\\r\\ncompensation for the indignities and sufferings which he endured at\\r\\nhome. Fifty years since the crusted port of the Middle Temple could\\r\\nsoothe the heart at night, without paining the head in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART III.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONEY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII.\\r\\n\\r\\nFEES TO COUNSEL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom time immemorial popular satire has been equally ready to fix the\\r\\nshame of avarice upon Divinity Physic, and Law; and it cannot be denied\\r\\nthat in this matter the sarcasms of the multitude are often sustained by\\r\\nthe indisputable evidence of history. The greed of the clergy for tithes\\r\\nand dues is not more widely proverbial than the doctor\\'s thirst for\\r\\nfees, or the advocate\\'s readiness to support injustice for the sake of\\r\\ngain. Of Guyllyam of Horseley, physician to Charles VI. of France,\\r\\nFroissart says, \"All his dayes he was one of the greatest nygardes that\\r\\never was;\" and the chronicler adds, \"With this rodde lightly all\\r\\nphysicians are beaten.\" In his address to the sergeants who were called\\r\\nsoon after his elevation to the Marble Chair, the Lord Keeper Puckering,\\r\\ndirecting attention to the grasping habits which too frequently\\r\\ndisgraced the leaders of the bar, observed: \"I am to exhort you also not\\r\\nto embrace multitude of causes, or to undertake more places of hearing\\r\\ncauses than you are well able to consider of or perform, lest thereby\\r\\nyou either disappoint your clients when their causes be heard, or come\\r\\nunprovided, or depart when their causes be in hearing. For it is all\\r\\none not to come, as either to come unprovided, or depart before it be\\r\\nended.\" Notwithstanding Lingard\\'s able defence of the Cardinal, scholars\\r\\nare still generally of opinion that Beaufort--the Chancellor who lent\\r\\nmoney on the king\\'s crown, the bishop who sold the Pope\\'s soldiers for a\\r\\nthousand marks--is a notable instance of the union of legal covetousness\\r\\nand ecclesiastical greed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe many causes which affect the value of money in different ages create\\r\\ninfinite perplexity for the antiquarian who wishes to estimate the\\r\\nprosperity of the bar in past times; but the few disjointed data, that\\r\\ncan be gathered from old records, create an impression that in the\\r\\nfourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ordinary fees of\\r\\neminent counsel were by no means exorbitant, although fortunate\\r\\npractitioners could make large incomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDugdale\\'s \\'Baronage\\' describes with delightful quaintness William de\\r\\nBeauchamp\\'s interview with his lawyers when that noble (on the death of\\r\\nJohn Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, _temp._ Richard II., without issue),\\r\\nclaimed the earl\\'s estates under an entail, in opposition to Edward\\r\\nHastings, the earl\\'s heir-male of the half-blood. \"Beauchamp,\" says\\r\\nDugdale, \"invited his learned counsel to his house in Paternoster Row,\\r\\nin the City of London; amongst whom were Robert Charlton (then a judge),\\r\\nWilliam Pinchbek, William Branchesley, and John Catesby (all learned\\r\\nlawyers); and after dinner, coming out of his chapel, in an angry mood,\\r\\nthrew to each of them a piece of gold, and said, \\'Sirs, I desire you\\r\\nforthwith to tell me whether I have any right or title to Hastings\\'\\r\\nlordship and lands.\\' Whereupon Pinchbek stood up (the rest being silent,\\r\\nfearing that he suspected them), and said, \\'No man here nor in England\\r\\ndare say that you have any right in them, except Hastings do quit his\\r\\nclaim therein; and should he do it, being now under age, it would be of\\r\\nno validitie.\\'\" Had Charlton, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,\\r\\ntaken gold for his opinion on a case put before him in his judicial\\r\\ncharacter, he would have violated his judicial oath. But in the earl\\'s\\r\\nhouse in Paternoster Row he was merely a counsellor learned in the law,\\r\\nnot a judge. Manifest perils attend a system which permits a judge in\\r\\nhis private character to give legal opinions concerning causes on which\\r\\nhe may be required to give judgment from the bench; but notwithstanding\\r\\nthose perils, there is no reason for thinking that Charlton on this\\r\\noccasion either broke law or etiquette. The fair inference from the\\r\\nmatter is, that in the closing years of the fourteenth century judges\\r\\nwere permitted to give opinions for money to their private clients,\\r\\nalthough they were forbidden to take gold or silver from any person\\r\\nhaving \"plea or process hanging before them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year of our Lord 1500 the corporation of Canterbury paid for\\r\\nadvice regarding their civic interests 3_s._ 4_d._ to each of three\\r\\nsergeants, and gave the Recorder of London 6_s._ 8_d._ as a\\r\\nretaining-fee. Five years later, Mr. Serjeant Wood received a fee of\\r\\n10_s._ from the Goldsmiths\\' Company; and it maybe fairly assumed, that\\r\\nso important and wealthy a body paid the sergeant on a liberal scale. In\\r\\nthe sixteenth century it was, and for several generations had been,\\r\\ncustomary for clients to provide food and drink for their counsel. Mr.\\r\\nFoss gives his readers the following list of items, taken from a bill of\\r\\ncosts, made in the reign of Edward IV.:--\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                      _s._  _d._\\r\\nFor a breakfast at Westminster spent on our counsel     1    6\\r\\n\\r\\nTo another time for boat-hire in and out, and a\\r\\n  breakfast for two days                                1    6\\r\\n\\r\\nIn like manner the accountant of St. Margaret\\'s, Westminster, entered in\\r\\nthe parish books, \"Also, paid to Roger Fylpott, learned in the law, for\\r\\nhis counsel given, 3_s._ 8_d._, with 4_d._ for his dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA yet more remarkable custom was that which enabled clients to hire\\r\\ncounsel to plead for them at certain places, for a given time, in\\r\\nwhatever causes their eloquence might be required. There still exists\\r\\nthe record of an agreement by which, in the reign of Henry VII.,\\r\\nSergeant Yaxley bound himself to attend the assizes at York, Nottingham\\r\\nand Derby, and speak in court at each of those places, whenever his\\r\\nclient, Sir Robert Plumpton--\"that perpetual and always unfortunate\\r\\nlitigant,\" as he is called by Sergeant Manning--required him to do so.\\r\\nThis interesting document runs thus--\"This bill, indented at London the\\r\\n18th day of July, the 16th yeare of the reigne of King Henry the 7th,\\r\\nwitnesseth that John Yaxley, Sergeant-at-Law, shall be at the next\\r\\nassizes to be holden at York, Nottin., and Derb., if they be holden and\\r\\nkept, and there to be of council with Sir Robert Plumpton, knight, such\\r\\nassizes and actions as the said Sir Robert shall require the said John\\r\\nYaxley, for the which premises, as well as for his costs and his\\r\\nlabours, John Pulan, gentleman, bindeth him by thease presents to\\r\\ncontent and pay to the said John Yaxley 40 marks sterling at the feast\\r\\nof the Nativetie of our Lady next coming, or within eight days next\\r\\nfollowing, with 5 li paid aforehand, parcell of paiment of the said 40\\r\\nmarks. Provided alway that if the said John Yaxley have knowledg and\\r\\nwarning only to cum to Nottin. and Derby, then the said John Yaxley is\\r\\nagread by these presents to take only xv li besides the 5 li aforesaid.\\r\\nProvided alwaies that if the said John Yaxley have knowledg and warning\\r\\nto take no labour in this matter, then he to reteine and hold the said 5\\r\\nli resaived for his good will and labour. In witness hereof, the said\\r\\nJohn Yaxley, serjeant, to the part of this indenture remaining with the\\r\\nsaid John Pulan have put his seale the day and yeare above-written.\\r\\nProvided also that the said Robert Plumpton shall beare the charges of\\r\\nthe said John Yaxley, as well at York as at Nottingham and Derby, and\\r\\nalso to content and pay the said money to the said John Yaxley comed to\\r\\nthe said assizes att Nott., Derb., and York. JOHN YAXLEY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis remarkable agreement--made after Richard III. had vainly endeavored\\r\\nto compose by arbitration the differences between Sir Robert and Sir\\r\\nRobert\\'s heir-general--certifies that Sir Robert Plumpton engaged to\\r\\nprovide the sergeant with suitable entertainment at the assize towns,\\r\\nand also throws light upon the origin of retaining-fees. It appears from\\r\\nthe agreement that in olden time a retaining fee was merely part\\r\\n(surrendered in advance) of a certain sum stipulated to be paid for\\r\\ncertain services. In principle it was identical with the payment of the\\r\\nshilling, still given in rural districts, to domestic servants on an\\r\\nagreement for service, and with the transfer of the queen\\'s shilling\\r\\ngiven to every soldier on enlistment. There is no need to mention the\\r\\nclassic origin of this ancient mode of giving force to a contract.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the \\'Household and Privy Purse Expenses of the Le Stranges of\\r\\nHunstanton,\\' published in the Archæologia, may be gleamed some\\r\\ninteresting particulars relating to the payment of counsel in the reign\\r\\nof Henry VIII. In 1520, Mr. Cristofer Jenney received from the Le\\r\\nStranges a half-yearly fee of ten shillings; and this general retainer\\r\\nwas continued on the same terms till 1527, when the fee was raised from\\r\\n£1 per annum to a yearly payment of £2 13_s._ 4_d._ To Mr. Knightley was\\r\\npaid the sum of 8_s._ 11_d._ \"for his fee, and that money yt he layde\\r\\noute for suying of Simon Holden;\" and the same lawyer also received at\\r\\nanother time 14_s._ 3_d._ \"for his fee and cost of sute for iii termes.\"\\r\\nA fee of 6_s._ 8_d._ was paid to \"Mr. Spelman, s\\'jeant, for his counsell\\r\\nin makyng my answer in ye Duchy Cham.;\" and the same serjeant received\\r\\na fee of 3_s._ 4_d._ \"for his counsell in putting in of the answer.\"\\r\\nFees of 3_s._ 4_d._ were in like manner given \"for counsell\" to Mr.\\r\\nKnightley and Mr. Whyte; and in 1534, Mr. Yelverton was remunerated \"for\\r\\nhis counsell\" with the unusually liberal honorarium of twenty shillings.\\r\\nFrom the household book of the Earl of Northumberland, it appears that\\r\\norder was made, in this same reign, for \"every oone of my lordes\\r\\ncounsaill to have c\\'s. fees, if he have it in household and not by\\r\\npatent.\" After the earl\\'s establishment was reduced to forty-two\\r\\npersons, it still retained \"one of my lordes counsaill for annswering\\r\\nand riddying of causes, whenne sutors cometh to my lord.\" At a time when\\r\\nevery lord was required to administer justice to his tenants and the\\r\\ninferior people of his territory, a counsellor learned in the law, was\\r\\nan important and most necessary officer in a grand seigneur\\'s retinue.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst Sir Thomas More lived in Bucklersbury, he \"gained, without grief,\\r\\nnot so little as £400 by the year.\" This income doubtless accrued from\\r\\nthe emoluments of his judicial appointment in the City, as well as from\\r\\nhis practice at Westminster and elsewhere. In Henry VIII.\\'s time it was\\r\\na very considerable income, such as was equalled by few leaders of the\\r\\nbar not holding high office under the Crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Elizabeth\\'s reign, and during the time of her successor, barristers\\'\\r\\nfees show a tendency toward increase; and the lawyers who were employed\\r\\nas advocates for the Crown, or held judicial appointments, acquired\\r\\nprincely incomes, and in some cases amassed large fortunes. Fees of\\r\\n20_s._ were more generally paid to counsel under the virgin queen, than\\r\\nin the days of her father; but still half that fee was not thought too\\r\\nsmall a sum for an opinion given by Her Majesty\\'s Solicitor General.\\r\\nIndeed, the ten-shilling fee was a very usual fee in Elizabeth\\'s reign;\\r\\nand it long continued an ordinary payment for one opinion on a case, or\\r\\nfor one speech in a cause of no great importance and of few\\r\\ndifficulties. \\'A barrister is like Balaam\\'s ass, only speaking when he\\r\\nsees the angel,\\' was a familiar saying in the seventeenth century. In\\r\\nChancery, however, by an ordinance of the Lords Commissioners passed in\\r\\n1654, to regulate the conduct of suits and the payments to masters,\\r\\ncounsel, and solicitors, it was arranged that on the hearing of a cause,\\r\\nutter-barristers should receive £1 fees, whilst the Lord Protector\\'s\\r\\ncounsel and sergeants-at-law should receive £2 fees, _i.e._, \\'double\\r\\nfees.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe archives of Lyme Regis show that under Elizabeth the usage was\\r\\nmaintained of supplying counsel with delicacies of the table, and also\\r\\nof providing them with means of locomotion. Here are some items in an\\r\\nold record of disbursements made by the corporation of Lyme\\r\\nRegis:--\"A.D. Paid for Wine carried with us to Mr. Poulett--£0 3_s._\\r\\n6_d._; Wine and sugar given to Mr. Poulett, £0 3_s._ 4_d._; Horse-hire,\\r\\nand for the Sergeant to ride to Mr. Walrond, of Bovey, and for a loaf of\\r\\nsugar, and for conserves given there to Mr. Poppel, £1 1_s._ 0_d._; Wine\\r\\nand sugar given to Judge Anderson, £0 3_s._ 4_d._ A bottle and sugar\\r\\ngiven to Mr. Gibbs (a lawyer).\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Elizabeth, the allowance made to Queen\\'s Sergeants was £26 6_s._\\r\\n8_d._ for fee, reward, and robes; and £20. for his services whenever a\\r\\nQueen\\'s Sergeant travelled circuit as Justice of Assize. The fee for her\\r\\nSolicitor General was £50. When Francis Bacon was created King\\'s Counsel\\r\\nto James I., an annual salary of forty pounds was assigned to him from\\r\\nthe royal purse; and down to William IV.\\'s time, King\\'s Counsel received\\r\\na stipend of £40 a year, and an allowance for stationery. Under the last\\r\\nmentioned monarch, however, the stipend and allowance were both\\r\\nwithdrawn; and at present the status of a Q.C. is purely an affair of\\r\\nprofessional precedence, to which no fixed emolument is attached.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a list of the fees, paid from the royal purse to each judge or crown\\r\\nlawyer under James I., would afford no indication as to the incomes\\r\\nenjoyed by the leading members of the bench and bar at that period. The\\r\\nsalaries paid to those officers were merely retaining fees, and their\\r\\nchief remuneration consisted of a large number of smaller fees. Like the\\r\\njudges of prior reigns, King James\\'s judges were forbidden to accept\\r\\n_presents_ from actual suitors; but no suitor could obtain a hearing\\r\\nfrom any one of them, until he had paid into court certain fees, of\\r\\nwhich the fattest was a sum of money for the judge\\'s personal use. At\\r\\none time many persons labored under an erroneous impression, that as\\r\\njudges were forbidden to accept presents from actual suitors, the honest\\r\\njudge of past times had no revenue besides his specified salary and\\r\\nallowance. Like the king\\'s judges, the king\\'s counsellors frequently\\r\\nmade great incomes by fees, though their nominal salaries were\\r\\ninvariably insignificant. At a time when Francis Bacon was James\\'s\\r\\nAttorney General, and received no more than £81 6_s._ 8_d._ for his\\r\\nyearly salary, he made £6000 per annum in his profession; and of that\\r\\nincome--a royal income in those days--the greater portion consisted of\\r\\nfees paid to him for attending to the king\\'s business. \"I shall now,\"\\r\\nBacon wrote to the king, \"again make oblation to your Majesty,--first of\\r\\nmy heart, then of my service; thirdly, of my place of Attorney, which I\\r\\nthink is honestly worth £6000 per annum; and fourthly, of my place in\\r\\nthe Star Chamber, which is worth £1600 per annum, and with the favor and\\r\\ncountenance of a Chancellor, much more.\" Coke had made a still larger\\r\\nincome during his tenure of the Attorney\\'s place, the fees from his\\r\\nprivate official practice amounting to no loss a sum than seven\\r\\nthousand pounds in a single year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt later periods of the seventeenth century barristers made large\\r\\nincomes, but the fees seem to have been by no means exorbitant. Junior\\r\\nbarristers received very modest payments, and it would appear that\\r\\njuniors received fees from eminent counsel for opinions and other\\r\\nprofessional services. Whilst he acted as treasurer of the Middle\\r\\nTemple, at an early period of his career, Whitelock received a fee from\\r\\nAttorney General Noy. \"Upon my carrying the bill,\" writes Whitelock, \"to\\r\\nMr. Attorney General Noy for his signature, with that of the other\\r\\nbenchers, he was pleased to advise with me about a patent the king had\\r\\ncommanded him to draw, upon which he gave me a fee for it out of his\\r\\nlittle purse, saying, \\'Here, take those single pence,\\' which amounted to\\r\\neleven groats, \\'and I give you more than an attorney\\'s fee, because you\\r\\nwill be a better man than the Attorney General. This you will find to be\\r\\ntrue.\\' After much other drollery, wherein he delighted and excelled, we\\r\\nparted, abundance of company attending to speak to him all this time.\"\\r\\nOf course the payment itself was no part of the drollery to which\\r\\nWhitelock alludes, for as a gentleman he could not have taken money\\r\\nproffered to him in jest, unless etiquette encouraged him to look for\\r\\nit, and allowed him to accept it. The incident justifies the inference\\r\\nthat the services of junior counsel to senior barristers--services at\\r\\nthe present time termed \\'devilling\\'--were formerly remunerated with cash\\r\\npayments.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the close of Charles I.\\'s reign--at a time when political\\r\\ndistractions were injuriously affecting the legal profession, especially\\r\\nthe staunch royalists of the long robe--Maynard, the Parliamentary\\r\\nlawyer, received on one round of the Western Circuit, £700, \"which,\"\\r\\nobserves Whitelock, to whom Maynard communicated the fact, \"I believe\\r\\nwas more than any one of our profession got before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the incomes made by eminent counsel in Charles II.\\'s time,\\r\\nmany _data_ are preserved in diaries and memoirs. That a thousand a year\\r\\nwas looked upon as a good income for a flourishing practitioner of the\\r\\n\\'merry monarch\\'s\\' Chancery bar, may be gathered from a passage in\\r\\n\\'Pepys\\'s Diary,\\' where the writer records the compliments paid to him\\r\\nregarding his courageous and eloquent defence of the Admiralty, before\\r\\nthe House of Commons, in March, 1668. Under the influence of half-a-pint\\r\\nof mulled sack and a dram of brandy, the Admiralty clerk made such a\\r\\nspirited and successful speech in behalf of his department, that he was\\r\\nthought to have effectually silenced all grumblers against the\\r\\nmanagement of his Majesty\\'s navy. Compliments flowed in upon the orator\\r\\nfrom all directions. Sir William Coventry pledged his judgment that the\\r\\nfame of the oration would last for ever in the Commons; silver-tongued\\r\\nSir Heneage Finch, in the blandest tones, averred that no other living\\r\\nman could have made so excellent a speech; the placemen of the Admiralty\\r\\nvied with each other in expressions of delight and admiration; and one\\r\\nflatterer, whose name is not recorded, caused Mr. Pepys infinite\\r\\npleasure by saying that the speaker who had routed the accusers of a\\r\\ngovernment office, might easily earn a thousand a year at the Chancery\\r\\nbar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat sum, however, is insignificant when it is compared with the incomes\\r\\nmade by the most fortunate advocates of that period. Eminent speakers of\\r\\nthe Common Law Bar made between £2000 and £3500 per annum on circuit and\\r\\nat Westminster, without the aid of king\\'s business; and still larger\\r\\nreceipts were recorded in the fee-books of his Majesty\\'s attorneys and\\r\\nsolicitors. At the Chancery bar of the second Charles, there was at\\r\\nleast one lawyer, who in one year made considerably more than four times\\r\\nthe income that was suggested to Pepys\\'s vanity and self-complacence. At\\r\\nStanford Court, Worcestershire, is preserved a fee-book kept by Sir\\r\\nFrancis Winnington, Solicitor-General to the \\'merry monarch,\\' from\\r\\nDecember 1674 to January 13, 1679, from the entries of which record the\\r\\nreader may form a tolerably correct estimate of the professional\\r\\nrevenues of successful lawyers at that time. In Easter Term, 1671, Sir\\r\\nFrancis pocketed £459; in Trinity Term £449 10s.; in Michaelmas Term\\r\\n£521; and in Hilary Term 1672, £361 10s.; the income for the year being\\r\\n£1791, without his earnings on the Oxford Circuit and during vacation.\\r\\nIn 1673, Sir Francis received £3371; in 1674, he earned £3560;[8] and in\\r\\n1675--_i.e._, the first year of his tenure of the Solicitor\\'s\\r\\noffice--his professional income wars £4066, of which sum £429 were\\r\\noffice fees. Concerning the Attorney-General\\'s receipts about this time,\\r\\nwe have sufficient information from Roger North, who records that his\\r\\nbrother, whilst Attorney General, made nearly seven thousand pounds in\\r\\none year, from private and official business. It is noteworthy that\\r\\nNorth, as Attorney General, made the same income which Coke realized in\\r\\nthe same office at the commencement of the century. But under the\\r\\nStuarts this large income of £7000--in those days a princely\\r\\nrevenue--was earned by work so perilous and fruitful of obloquy, that\\r\\neven Sir Francis, who loved money and cared little for public esteem,\\r\\nwas glad to resign the post of Attorney and retire to the Pleas with\\r\\n£4000 a year. That the fees of the Chancery lawyers under Charles II.\\r\\nwere regulated upon a liberal scale we know from Roger North, and the\\r\\nrecord of Sir John King\\'s success. Speaking of his brother Francis, the\\r\\nbiographer says: \"After he, as king\\'s counsel, came within the bar, he\\r\\nbegan to have calls into the Court of Chancery; which he liked very\\r\\nwell, because the quantity of the business, _as well as the fees_, was\\r\\ngreater; but his home was the King\\'s Bench, where he sat and reported\\r\\nlike as other practitioners.\" And in Sir John King\\'s memoirs it is\\r\\nrecorded that in 1676 he made £4700, and that he received from £40 to\\r\\n£50 a day during the last four days of his appearance in court. Dying in\\r\\n1677,[9] whilst his supremacy in his own court was at its height, Sir\\r\\nJohn King was long spoken of as a singularly successful Chancery\\r\\nbarrister.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Francis North\\'s mode of taking and storing his fees, the \\'Life of\\r\\nLord Keeper Guildford\\' gives the following picture: \"His business\\r\\nincreased, even while he was Solicitor, to be so much as to have\\r\\noverwhelmed one less dexterous; but when he was made Attorney General,\\r\\nthough his gains by his office were great, they were much greater by his\\r\\npractice; for that flowed in upon him like an orage, enough to overset\\r\\none that had not an extraordinary readiness in business. His skull-caps,\\r\\nwhich he wore when he had leisure to observe his constitution, as I\\r\\ntouched before, were now destined to lie in a drawer to receive the\\r\\nmoney that came in by fees. One had the gold, another the crowns and\\r\\nhalf-crowns, and another the smaller money. When these vessels were\\r\\nfull, they were committed to his friend (the Hon. Roger North), who was\\r\\nconstantly near him, to tell out the cash, and put it into the bags\\r\\naccording to the contents; and so they went to his treasurers, Blanchard\\r\\nand Child, goldsmiths, Temple Bar.\"[10] In the days of wigs, skull-caps\\r\\nlike those which Francis North used as receptacles for money, were very\\r\\ngenerally worn by men of all classes and employments. On returning to\\r\\nthe privacy of his home, a careful citizen usually laid aside his costly\\r\\nwig, and replaced it with a cheap and durable skull-cap, before he sat\\r\\ndown in his parlor. So also, men careful of their health often wore\\r\\nskull-caps _under_ their wigs, on occasions when they were required to\\r\\nendure a raw atmosphere without the protection of their beavers. In days\\r\\nwhen the law-courts were held in the open hall of Westminster, and\\r\\nlawyers practising therein, were compelled to sit or speak for hours\\r\\ntogether, exposed to sharp currents of cold air, it was customary for\\r\\nwearers of the long robe to place between their wigs and natural hair\\r\\nclosely-fitting caps, made of stout silk or soft leather. But more\\r\\ninteresting than the money-caps, are the fees which they contained. The\\r\\nringing of the gold pieces, the clink of the crowns with the\\r\\nhalf-crowns, and the rattle of the smaller money, led back the barrister\\r\\nto those happier and remote times, when the \\'inferior order\\' of the\\r\\nprofession paid the superior order with \\'money down;\\' when, the advocate\\r\\nnever opened his mouth till his fingers had closed upon the gold of his\\r\\ntrustful client; when \\'credit\\' was unknown in transactions between\\r\\ncounsel and attorney;--that truly _golden_ age of the bar, when the\\r\\nbarrister was less suspicious of the attorney, and the attorney held\\r\\nless power over the barrister.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving profited by the liberal payments of Chancery whilst he was an\\r\\nadvocate, Lord Keeper Guildford destroyed one source of profit to\\r\\ncounsel from which Francis North, the barrister, had drawn many a capful\\r\\nof money. Saith Roger, \"He began to rescind all motions for speeding and\\r\\ndelaying the hearing of causes besides the ordinary rule of court; and\\r\\nthis lopped off a limb of the motion practice. I have heard Sir John\\r\\nChurchill, a famous Chancery practitioner, say, that in his walk from\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn down to the Temple Hall, where, in the Lord Keeper\\r\\nBridgman\\'s time, causes and motions out of term were heard, he had taken\\r\\n£28. with breviates only for motions and defences for hastening and\\r\\nretarding hearings. His lordship said, that the rule of the court\\r\\nallowed time enough for any one to proceed or defend; and if, for\\r\\nspecial reasons, he should give way to orders for timing matters, it\\r\\nwould let in a deluge of vexatious pretenses, which, true or false,\\r\\nbeing asserted by the counsel with equal assurance, distracted the\\r\\ncourt and confounded the suitors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLet due honor be rendered to one Caroline, lawyer, who was remarkable\\r\\nfor his liberality to clients, and carelessness of his own pecuniary\\r\\ninterests. From his various biographers, many pleasant stories may be\\r\\ngleaned concerning Hale\\'s freedom from base love of money. In his days,\\r\\nand long afterward, professional etiquette permitted clients and counsel\\r\\nto hold intercourse without the intervention of an attorney. Suitors,\\r\\ntherefore, frequently addressed him personally and paid for his advice\\r\\nwith their own hands, just as patients are still accustomed to fee their\\r\\ndoctors. To these personal applicants, and also to clients who\\r\\napproached him by their agents, he was very liberal. \"When those who\\r\\ncame to ask his counsel gave him a piece, he used to give back the half,\\r\\nand to make ten shillings his fee in ordinary matters that did not\\r\\nrequire much time or study.\" From this it may be inferred that whilst\\r\\nHale was an eminent member of the bar, twenty shillings was the usual\\r\\nfee to a leading counsel, and an angel the customary honorarium to an\\r\\nordinary practitioner. As readers have already been told, the angel[11]\\r\\nwas a common fee in the seventeenth century; but the story of Hale\\'s\\r\\ngenerous usage implies that his more distinguished contemporaries were\\r\\nwont to look for and accept a double fee. Moreover, the anecdote would\\r\\nnot be told in Hale\\'s honor, if etiquette had fixed the double fee as\\r\\nthe minimum of remuneration for a superior barrister\\'s opinion. He was\\r\\nfrequently employed in arbitration cases, and as an arbitrator he\\r\\nsteadily refused payment for his services to legal disputants, saying,\\r\\nin explanation of his moderation, \"In these cases I am made a judge, and\\r\\na judge ought to take no money.\" The misapprehension as to the nature of\\r\\nan arbitrator\\'s functions, displayed in these words, gives an\\r\\ninstructive insight into the mental constitution of the judge who wrote\\r\\non natural science, and at the same time exerted himself to secure the\\r\\nconviction of witches. A more pleasant and commendable illustration of\\r\\nhis conscientiousness in pecuniary matters, is found in the steadiness\\r\\nwith which he refused to throw upon society the spurious coin which he\\r\\nhad taken from his clients. In a tone of surprise that raises a smile at\\r\\nthe average morality of our forefathers, Bishop Burnet tells of Hale:\\r\\n\"Another remarkable instance of his justice and goodness was, that when\\r\\nhe found ill money had been put into his hands, he would never suffer it\\r\\nto be vented again; for he thought it was no excuse for him to put false\\r\\nmoney in other people\\'s hands, because some had put it into his. A great\\r\\nheap of this he had gathered together, for many had so abused his\\r\\ngoodness as to mix base money among the fees that were given him.\" In\\r\\nthis particular case, the judge\\'s virtue was its own reward. His house\\r\\nbeing entered by burglars, this accumulation of bad money attracted the\\r\\nnotice of the robbers, who selected it from a variety of goods and\\r\\nchattels, and carried it off under the impression that it was the\\r\\nlawyer\\'s hoarded treasure. Besides large sums expended on unusual acts\\r\\nof charity, this good man habitually distributed amongst the poor a\\r\\ntithe of his professional earnings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the seventeenth century, General Retainers were very common, and the\\r\\ncounsel learned in the law, were ready to accept them from persons of\\r\\nlow extraction and questionable repute. Indeed, no upstart deemed\\r\\nhimself properly equipped for a campaign at court, until he had recorded\\r\\na fictitious pedigree at the Herald\\'s College, taken a barrister as well\\r\\nas a doctor into regular employment, and hired a curate to say grace\\r\\ndaily at his table. In the summer of his vile triumph, Titus Oates was\\r\\nattended, on public occasions, by a robed counsel and a physician.\\r\\n\\r\\n[8] In his \\'Survey of the State of England in 1685,\\' Macauley--giving\\r\\none of those misleading references with which his history abounds--says:\\r\\n\"A thousand a year was thought a large income for a barrister. Two\\r\\nthousand a year was hardly to be made in the Court of King\\'s Bench,\\r\\nexcept by crown lawyers.\" Whilst making the first statement, he\\r\\ndoubtless remembered the passage in \\'Pepys\\'s Diary.\\' For the second\\r\\nstatement, he refers to \\'Layton\\'s Conversation with Chief Justice Hale.\\'\\r\\nIt is fair to assume that Lord Macauley had never seen Sir Francis\\r\\nWinnington\\'s fee-book.\\r\\n\\r\\n[9] In the fourth day of his fever, he being att the Chancery Bar, he\\r\\nfell so ill of the fever, that he was forced to leave the Court and come\\r\\nto his chambers in the Temple, with one of his clerks, which constantly\\r\\nwayted on him and carried his bags of writings for his pleadings, and\\r\\nthere told him that he should return to every clyent his breviat and his\\r\\nfee, for he could serve them no longer, for he had done with this world,\\r\\nand thence came home to his house in Salisbury Court, and took his\\r\\nbed.... And there he sequestered himself to meditation between God and\\r\\nhis own soul, without the least regret, and quietly and patiently\\r\\ncontented himself with the will of God.--_Vide Memoir of Sir John King,\\r\\nKnt., written by his Father._\\r\\n\\r\\n[10] The lawyers of the seventeenth century were accustomed to make a\\r\\nshow of their fees to the clients who called upon them. Hudibras\\'s\\r\\nlawyer (Hud., Part iii. cant. 3) is described as sitting in state with\\r\\nhis books and money before him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To this brave man the knight repairs For counsel in his law affairs,\\r\\nAnd found him mounted in his pew, With books and money placed for shew,\\r\\nLike nest-eggs, to make clients lay, And for his false, opinion pay: To\\r\\nwhom the knight, with comely grace, Put off his hat to put his case,\\r\\nWhich he as proudly entertain\\'d As the other courteously strain\\'d; And\\r\\nto assure him \\'twas not that He looked for, bid him put on\\'s hat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Victoria, the needy junior is compelled, for the sake of\\r\\nappearances, to furnish his shelves with law books, and cover his table\\r\\nwith counterfeit briefs. Under the Stuarts, he placed a bowl of spurious\\r\\nmoney amongst the sham papers that lay upon his table.\\r\\n\\r\\n[11] In the \\'Serviens ad Legem,\\' Mr. Sergeant Manning raises question\\r\\nconcerning the antiquity of _guineas_ and half-guineas, with the\\r\\nfollowing remarks:--\"Should any cavil be raised against this jocular\\r\\nallusion, on the ground that guineas and half-guineas were unknown to\\r\\nsergeants who flourished in the sixteenth century, the objector might be\\r\\nreminded, that in antique records, instances occur in which the\\r\\n\\'guianois d\\'or,\\' issued from the ducal mint at Bordeaux, by the\\r\\nauthority of the Plantagenet sovereigns of Guienne, were by the same\\r\\nauthority, made current among their English subjects; and it might be\\r\\nsuggested that those who have gone to the coast of Africa for the origin\\r\\nof the modern guinea, need not have carried their researches beyond the\\r\\nBay of Biscay. _Quære_, whether the Guinea Coast itself may not owe its\\r\\nname to the \\'guianois d\\'or\\' for which it furnished the raw material.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nRETAINERS GENERAL AND SPECIAL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPemberton\\'s fees for his services in behalf of the Seven Bishops show\\r\\nthat the most eminent counsel of his time were content with very modest\\r\\nremuneration for advice and eloquence. From the bill of an attorney\\r\\nemployed in that famous trial, it appears that the ex-Chief Justice was\\r\\npaid a retaining-fee of five guineas, and received twenty guineas with\\r\\nhis brief. He also pocketed three guineas for a consultation. At the\\r\\npresent date, thirty times the sum of these paltry payments would be\\r\\nthought an inadequate compensation for such zeal, judgment, and ability\\r\\nas Francis Pemberton displayed in the defence of his reverend clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, though lawyers were paid thus moderately in the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury, the complaints concerning their avarice and extortions were\\r\\nloud and universal. This public discontent was due to the inordinate\\r\\nexactions of judges and place-holders rather than to the conduct of\\r\\nbarristers and attorneys; but popular displeasure seldom cares to\\r\\ndiscriminate between the blameless and the culpable members of an\\r\\nobnoxious system, or to distinguish between the errors of ancient custom\\r\\nand the qualities of those persons who are required to carry out old\\r\\nrules. Hence the really honest and useful practitioners of the law\\r\\nendured a full share of the obloquy caused by the misconduct of venal\\r\\njustices and corrupt officials. Counsel, attorneys, and even scriveners\\r\\ncame in for abuse. It was averred that they conspired to pick the public\\r\\npocket; that eminent conveyancers not less than copying clerks, swelled\\r\\ntheir emoluments by knavish tricks. They would talk for the mere purpose\\r\\nof protracting litigation, injure their clients by vexations and\\r\\nbootless delays, and do their work so that they might be fed for doing\\r\\nit again. Draughtsmen find their clerks wrote loosely and wordily,\\r\\nbecause they were paid by the folio. \"A term,\" writes the quaint author\\r\\nof \\'Saint Hillaries Teares,\\' in 1642, \"so like a vacation; the prime\\r\\ncourt, the Chancery (wherein the clerks had wont to dash their clients\\r\\nout of countenance with long dashes); the examiners to take the\\r\\ndepositions in hyperboles, and roundabout _Robinhood_ circumstances with\\r\\n_saids_ and _aforesaids_, to enlarge the number of sheets.\" \\'Hudibras\\'\\r\\ncontains, amongst other pungent satires against the usages of lawyers,\\r\\nan allusion to this characteristic custom of legal draughtsmen, who\\r\\nbeing paid by the sheet, were wont\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"To make \\'twixt words and lines large gaps,\\r\\n   Wide as meridians in maps;\\r\\n   To squander paper and spare ink,\\r\\n   Or cheat men of their words some think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following century the abuses consequent on the objectionable\\r\\nsystem of folio-payment were noticed in a parliamentary report (bearing\\r\\ndate November 8, 1740), which was the most important result of an\\r\\nineffectual attempt to reform the superior courts of law and to lessen\\r\\nthe expenses of litigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore is known about the professional receipts of lawyers since the\\r\\nRevolution of 1688 than can be discovered concerning the incomes of\\r\\ntheir precursors in Westminster Hall. For six years, commencing with\\r\\nMichaelmas Term, 1719, Sir John Cheshire, King\\'s Sergeant, made an\\r\\naverage annual income of 3241_l._ Being then sixty-three years of age,\\r\\nhe limited his practice to the Common Pleas, and during the next six\\r\\nyears made in that one court 1320_l._ per annum. Mr. Foss, to whom the\\r\\npresent writer is indebted for these particulars with regard to Sir John\\r\\nCheshire\\'s receipts, adds: \"The fees of counsel\\'s clerks form a great\\r\\ncontrast with those that are now demanded, being only threepence on a\\r\\nfee of half-a-guinea, sixpence for a guinea, and one shilling for two\\r\\nguineas.\" Of course the increase of clerk\\'s fees tells more in favor of\\r\\nthe master than the servant. At the present time the clerk of a\\r\\nbarrister in fairly lucrative practice costs his master nothing.\\r\\nBountifully paid by his employer\\'s clients, he receives no salary from\\r\\nthe counsellor whom he serves; whereas, in old times, when his fees were\\r\\nfixed at the low rate just mentioned, the clerk could not live and\\r\\nmaintain a family upon them, unless his master belonged to the most\\r\\nsuccessful grade of his order.\\r\\n\\r\\nHorace Walpole tells his readers that Charles Yorke \"was reported to\\r\\nhave received 100,000 guineas in fees;\" but his fee-book shows that his\\r\\nprofessional rise was by no means so rapid as those who knew him in his\\r\\nsunniest days generally supposed. The story of his growing fortunes is\\r\\nindicated in the following statement of successive incomes:--1st year of\\r\\npractice at the bar, 121_l._ 2nd, 201_l._; 3rd and 4th, between 300_l._\\r\\nand 400_l._ per annum; 5th, 700_l._; 6th, 800_l._; 7th, 1000_l._; 9th,\\r\\n1600_l._; 10th, 2500_l._ Whilst Solicitor General he made 3400_l._ in\\r\\n1757; and in the following year he earned 5000_l._ His receipts during\\r\\nthe last year of his tenure of the Attorney Generalship amounted to\\r\\n7322_l._ The reader should observe that as Attorney General he made but\\r\\nlittle more than Coke had realized in the same office,--a fact serving\\r\\nto show how much better paid were Crown lawyers in times when they held\\r\\noffice like judges during the Sovereign\\'s pleasure, than in these latter\\r\\ndays when they retire from place together with their political parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference between the incomes of Scotch advocates and English\\r\\nbarristers was far greater in the eighteenth century than at the present\\r\\ntime, although in our own day the receipts of several second-rate\\r\\nlawyers of the Temple and Lincoln\\'s Inn far surpass the revenues of the\\r\\nmost successful advocates of the Edinburgh faculty. A hundred and thirty\\r\\nyears since a Scotch barrister who earned 500_l._ per annum by his\\r\\nprofession was esteemed notably successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as Charles Yorke\\'s fee-book shows us the pecuniary position of an\\r\\neminent English barrister in the middle of the last century, John\\r\\nScott\\'s list of receipts displays the prosperity of a very fortunate\\r\\nCrown lawyer in the next generation. Without imputing motives the\\r\\npresent writer, may venture to say that Lord Eldon\\'s assertions with\\r\\nregard to his earnings at the bar, and his judicial incomes, were not in\\r\\nstrict accordance with the evidence of his private accounts. He used to\\r\\nsay that his first year\\'s earnings in his profession amounted to\\r\\nhalf-a-guinea, but there is conclusive proof that he had a considerable\\r\\nquantity of lucrative business in the same year. \"When I was called to\\r\\nthe bar,\" it was his humor to say, \"Bessie and I thought all our\\r\\ntroubles were over, business was to pour in, and we were to be rich\\r\\nalmost immediately. So I made a bargain with her that during the\\r\\nfollowing year all the money I should receive in the first eleven\\r\\nmonths should be mine, and whatever I should get in the twelfth month\\r\\nshould be hers. That was our agreement, and how do you think it turned\\r\\nout? In the twelfth month I received half-a-guinea--eighteenpence went\\r\\nfor charity, and Bessy got nine shillings. In the other eleven months I\\r\\ngot one shilling.\" John Scott, be it remembered, was called to the bar\\r\\non February 9, 1776, and on October 2, of the same year, William Scott\\r\\nwrote to his brother Henry--\"My brother Jack seems highly pleased with\\r\\nhis circuit business. I hope it is only the beginning of future\\r\\ntriumphs. All appearances speak strongly in his favor.\" There is no need\\r\\nto call evidence to show that Eldon\\'s success was more than respectable\\r\\nfrom the outset of his career, and that he had not been called many\\r\\nyears before he was in the foremost rank of his profession. His fee-book\\r\\ngives the following account of his receipts in thirteen successive\\r\\nyears:--1786, 6833_l._ 7_s._; 1787, 7600_l._ 7_s._; 1788, 8419_l._\\r\\n14_s._; 1789, 9559_l._ 10_s._; 1790, 9684_l._ 15_s._; 1791, 10,213_l._\\r\\n13_s._ 6_d._; 1792, 9080_l._ 9_s._; 1793, 10,330_l._ 1_s._ 4_d._; 1794,\\r\\n11,592_l._; 1795, 11,149_l._ 15_s._ 4_d._; 1796, 12,140_l._ 15_s._\\r\\n8_d._; 1797, 10,861_l._ 5_s._ 8_d_; 1798, 10,557_l._ 17_s._ During the\\r\\nlast six of the above-mentioned years he was Attorney General, and\\r\\nduring the preceding four years Solicitor General.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough General Retainers are much less general than formerly, they are\\r\\nby no means obsolete. Noblemen could be mentioned who at the present\\r\\ntime engage counsel with periodical payments, special fees of course\\r\\nbeing also paid for each professional service. But the custom is dying\\r\\nout, and it is probable that after the lapse of another hundred years it\\r\\nwill not survive save amongst the usages of ancient corporations. Notice\\r\\nhas already been taken of Murray\\'s conduct when he returned nine hundred\\r\\nand ninety-five out of a thousand guineas to the Duchess of\\r\\nMarlborough, informing her that the professional fee with the general\\r\\nretainer was neither more nor less than five guineas. The annual salary\\r\\nof a Queen\\'s Counsel in past times was in fact a fee with a general\\r\\nretainer; but this periodic payment is no longer made to wearers of\\r\\nsilk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his learned work on \\'The Judges of England,\\' Mr. Foss observes: \"The\\r\\ncustom of retaining counsel in fee lingered in form, at least in one\\r\\nducal establishment. By a formal deed-poll between the proud Duke of\\r\\nSomerset and Sir Thomas Parker, dated July 19, 1707, the duke retains\\r\\nhim as his \\'standing counsell in ffee,\\' and gives and allows him \\'the\\r\\nyearly ffee of four markes, to be paid by my solicitor\\' at Michaelmas,\\r\\n\\'to continue during my will and pleasure.\\'\" Doubtless Mr. Foss is aware\\r\\nthat this custom still \\'lingers in form;\\' but the tone of his words\\r\\njustifies the opinion that he underrates the frequency with which\\r\\ngeneral retainers are still given. The \\'standing counsel\\' of civic and\\r\\ncommercial companies are counsel with general retainers, and usually\\r\\ntheir general retainers have fees attached to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe payments of English barristers have varied much more than the\\r\\nremunerations of English physicians. Whereas medical practitioners in\\r\\nevery age have received a certain definite sum for each consultation,\\r\\nand have been forbidden by etiquette to charge more or less than the\\r\\nfixed rate, lawyers have been allowed much freedom in estimating the\\r\\nworth of their labor. This difference between the usages of the two\\r\\nprofessions is mainly due to the fact, that the amount of time and\\r\\nmental effort demanded by patients at each visit or consultation is very\\r\\nnearly the same in all cases, whereas the requirements of clients are\\r\\nmuch more various. To get up the facts of a law-case may be the work of\\r\\nminutes, or hours, or days, or even weeks; to observe the symptoms of a\\r\\npatient, and to write a prescription, can be always accomplished within\\r\\nthe limits of a short morning call. In all times, however, the legal\\r\\nprofession has adopted certain scales of payment--that fixed the\\r\\n_minimum_ of remuneration, but left the advocate free to get more, as\\r\\ncircumstances might encourage him to raise his demands. Of the many good\\r\\nstories told of artifices by which barristers have delicately intimated\\r\\ntheir desire for higher payment, none is better than an anecdote\\r\\nrecorded of Sergeant Hill. A troublesome case being laid before this\\r\\nmost erudite of George III.\\'s sergeants, he returned it with a brief\\r\\nnote, that he \"saw more difficulty in the case than, _under all the\\r\\ncircumstances_, he could well solve.\" As the fee marked upon the case\\r\\nwas only a guinea, the attorney readily inferred that its smallness was\\r\\none of the circumstances which occasioned the counsel\\'s difficulty. The\\r\\ncase, therefore, was returned, with a fee of two guineas. Still\\r\\ndissatisfied, Sergeant Hill wrote that \"he saw no reason to change his\\r\\nopinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the etiquette of the bar no barrister is permitted to take a brief on\\r\\nany circuit, save that on which he habitually practises, unless he has\\r\\nreceived a special retainer; and no wearer of silk can be specially\\r\\nretained with a less fee than three hundred guineas. Erskine\\'s first\\r\\nspecial retainer was in the Dean of St. Asaph\\'s case, his first speech\\r\\nin which memorable cause was delivered when he had been called to the\\r\\nbar but little more than five years. From that time till his elevation\\r\\nto the bench he received on an average twelve special retainers a year,\\r\\nby which at the minimum of payment he made £3600 per annum. Besides\\r\\nbeing lucrative and honorable, this special employment greatly augmented\\r\\nhis practice in Westminster Hall, as it brought him in personal contact\\r\\nwith attorneys in every part of the country, and heightened his\\r\\npopularity amongst all classes of his fellow-countrymen. In 1786 he\\r\\nentirely withdrew from ordinary circuit practice, and confined his\\r\\nexertions in provincial courts to the causes for which he was specially\\r\\nretained. No advocate since his time has received an equal number of\\r\\nspecial retainers; and if he did not originate the custom of special\\r\\nretainers,[12] he was the first English barrister who ventured to reject\\r\\nall other briefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no need to recapitulate all the circumstances of Erskine\\'s\\r\\nrapid rise in his profession--a rise due to his effective brilliance and\\r\\nfervor in political trial: but this chapter on lawyers\\' fees would be\\r\\nculpably incomplete, if it failed to notice some of its pecuniary\\r\\nconsequences. In the eighth month after his call to the bar he thanked\\r\\nAdmiral Keppel for a splendid fee of one thousand pounds. A few years\\r\\nlater a legal gossip wrote: \"Everybody says that Erskine will be\\r\\nSolicitor General, and if he is, and indeed whether he is or not, he\\r\\nwill have had the most rapid rise that has been known at the bar. It is\\r\\nfour years and a half since he was called, and in that time he has\\r\\ncleared £8000 or £9000, besides paying his debts--got a silk gown, and\\r\\nbusiness of at least £3000 a year--a seat in Parliament--and, over and\\r\\nabove, has made his brother Lord Advocate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMerely to mention large fees without specifying the work by which they\\r\\nwere earned would mislead the reader. During the railway mania of 1845,\\r\\nthe few leaders of the parliamentary bar received prodigious fees; and\\r\\nin some cases the sums were paid for very little exertion. Frequently it\\r\\nhappened that a lawyer took heavy fees in causes, at no stage of which\\r\\nhe either made a speech or read a paper in the service of his too\\r\\nliberal employers. During that period of mad speculation the\\r\\ncommittee-rooms of the two Houses were an El Dorado to certain favored\\r\\nlawyers, who were alternately paid for speech and _silence_ with\\r\\nreckless profusion. But the time was so exceptional, that the fees\\r\\nreceived and the fortunes made in it by a score of lucky advocates and\\r\\nsolicitors cannot be fairly cited as facts illustrating the social\\r\\ncondition of legal practitioners. As a general rule, it may be stated\\r\\nthat large fortunes are not made at the bar by large fees. Our richest\\r\\nlawyers have made the bulk of their wealth by accumulating sufficient\\r\\nbut not exorbitant payments. In most cases the large fee has not been a\\r\\nvery liberal remuneration for the work done. Edward Law\\'s retainer for\\r\\nthe defence of Warren Hastings brought with it £500--a sum which caused\\r\\nour grandfathers to raise their hands in astonishment at the nabob\\'s\\r\\nmunificence; but the sum was in reality the reverse of liberal. In all,\\r\\nWarren Hastings paid his leading advocate considerably less than four\\r\\nthousand pounds; and if Law had not contrived to win the respect of\\r\\nsolicitors by his management of the defence, the case could not be said\\r\\nto have paid him for his trouble. So also the eminent advocate, who in\\r\\nthe great case of Small _v._ Attwood received a fee of £6000, was\\r\\nactually underpaid. When he made up the account of the special outlay\\r\\nnecessitated by that cause, and the value of business which the\\r\\nburdensome case compelled him to decline, he had small reason to\\r\\ncongratulate himself on his remuneration.\\r\\n\\r\\nA statement of the incomes made by chamber-barristers, and of the sums\\r\\nrealized by counsel in departments of the profession that do not invite\\r\\nthe attention of the general public, would astonish those uninformed\\r\\npersons who estimate the success of a barrister by the frequency with\\r\\nwhich his name appears in the newspaper reports of trials and suits. The\\r\\ntalkers of the bar enjoy more _éclat_ than the barristers who confine\\r\\nthemselves to chamber practice, and their labors lead to the honors of\\r\\nthe bench; but a young lawyer, bent only on the acquisition of wealth,\\r\\nis more likely to achieve his ambition by conveyancing or\\r\\narbitration-business than by court-work. Kenyon was never a popular or\\r\\nsuccessful advocate, but he made £3000 a year by answering cases.\\r\\nCharles Abbott at no time of his life could speak better than a\\r\\nvestryman of average ability; but by drawing informations and\\r\\nindictments, by writing opinions on cases, he made the greater part of\\r\\nthe eight thousand pounds which he returned as the amount of his\\r\\nprofessional receipts in 1807. In our own time, when that popular common\\r\\nlaw advocate, Mr. Edwin James, was omnipotent with juries, his income\\r\\nnever equalled the incomes of certain chamber-practitioners whose names\\r\\nare utterly unknown to the general body of English society.\\r\\n\\r\\n[12] Lord Campbell observes: \"Some say that special retainers began with\\r\\nErskine; but I doubt the fact.\" It is strange that there should be\\r\\nuncertainty as to the time when special retainers--unquestionably a\\r\\ncomparatively recent innovation in legal practice--came into vogue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nJUDICIAL CORRUPTION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo a young student making his first researches beneath the surface of\\r\\nEnglish history, few facts are more painful and perplexing than the\\r\\njudicial corruption which prevailed in every period of our country\\'s\\r\\ngrowth until quiet recent times--darkening the brightest pages of our\\r\\nannals, and disfiguring some of the greatest chieftains of our race.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere he narrates the fall and punishment of De Weyland towards the\\r\\nclose of the thirteenth century, Speed observes: \"While the Jews by\\r\\ntheir cruel usuries had in one way eaten up the people, the justiciars,\\r\\nlike another kind of Jews, had ruined them with delay in their suits,\\r\\nand enriched themselves with wicked convictions.\" Of judicial corruption\\r\\nin the reigns of Edward I. and Edward II. a vivid picture is given in a\\r\\npolitical ballad, composed in the time of one or the other of those\\r\\nmonarchs. Of this poem Mr. Wright, in his \\'Political Songs,\\' gives a\\r\\nfree version, a part of which runs thus:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Judges there are whom gifts and favorites control,\\r\\n   Content to serve the devil alone and take from him a toll;\\r\\n   If nature\\'s law forbids the judge from selling his decree,\\r\\n   How dread to those who finger bribes the punishment shall be.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Such judges have accomplices whom frequently they send\\r\\n   To get at those who claim some land, and whisper as a friend,\\r\\n   \\'\\'Tis I can help you with the judge, if you would wish to plead,\\r\\n   Give me but half, I\\'ll undertake before him you\\'ll succeed.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"The clerks who sit beneath the judge are open-mouthed as he,\\r\\n   As if they were half-famished and gaping for a fee;\\r\\n   Of those who give no money they soon pronounce the state,\\r\\n   However early they attend, they shall have long to wait.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"If comes some noble lady, in beauty and in pride,\\r\\n   With golden horns upon her head, her suit he\\'ll soon decide;\\r\\n   But she who has no charms, nor friends, and is for gifts too poor,\\r\\n   Her business all neglected, she\\'s weeping shown the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"But worse than all, within the court we some relators meet,\\r\\n   Who take from either side at once, and both their clients cheat;\\r\\n   The ushers, too, to poor men say, \\'You labor here in vain,\\r\\n   Unless you tip us all around, you may go back again.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"The sheriff\\'s hard upon the poor who cannot pay for rest,\\r\\n   Drags them about to every town, on all assizes press\\'d\\r\\n   Compell\\'d to take the oath prescrib\\'d without objection made,\\r\\n   For if they murmur and can\\'t pay, upon their backs they\\'re laid.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"They enter any private house, or abbey that they choose,\\r\\n   Where meat and drink and all things else are given as their dues;\\r\\n   And after dinner jewels too, or this were all in vain,\\r\\n   Bedels and garçons must receive, and all that form the train.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"And next must gallant robes be sent as presents to their wives,\\r\\n   Or from the manor of the host some one his cattle drives;\\r\\n   While he, poor man, is sent to gaol upon some false pretence,\\r\\n   And pays at last at double cost, ere he gets free from thence.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"I can\\'t but laugh to see their clerks, whom once I knew in need,\\r\\n   When to obtain a bailiwick they may at last succeed;\\r\\n   With pride in gait and countenance and with their necks erect\\r\\n   They lands and houses quickly buy and pleasant rents collect.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Grown rich they soon the poor despise, and new-made laws display,\\r\\n   Oppress their neighbors and become the wise men of their day;\\r\\n   Unsparing of the least offence, when they can have their will,\\r\\n   The hapless country all around with discontent they fill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourteenth century judicial corruption was so general and\\r\\nflagrant, that cries came from every quarter for the punishment of\\r\\noffenders. The Knights Hospitallers\\' Survey, made in the year 1338,\\r\\ngives us revelations that confound the indiscreet admirers of feudal\\r\\nmanners. From that source of information it appears that regular\\r\\nstipends were paid to persons \"tam in curia domini regis quam\\r\\njusticiariis, clericis, officiariis et aliis ministris, in diversis\\r\\ncuriis suis, ac etiam aliis familaribus magnatum tam pro terris\\r\\ntenementis redditbus et libertatibus Hospitalis, quam Templariorum, et\\r\\nmaxime pro terris Templariorum manutenendis.\" Of pensions to the amount\\r\\nof £440 mentioned in the account, £60 were paid to judges, clerks, and\\r\\nminor officers of courts. Robert de Sadington, the Chief Baron, received\\r\\n40 marks annually; twice a year the Knights Hospitallers presented caps\\r\\nto one hundred and forty officers of the Exchequer; and they expended\\r\\n200 marks _per annum_ on gifts that were distributed in law courts,\\r\\n\"_pro favore habendo_, et pro placitis habendis, et expensis\\r\\nparliamentorum.\" In that age, and for centuries later, it was customary\\r\\nfor wealthy men and great corporations to make valuable presents to the\\r\\njudges and chief servants the king\\'s courts; but it was always presumed\\r\\nthat the offerings were simple expressions of respect--not tribute\\r\\nrendered, \"pro favore habendo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBent on purifying the moral atmosphere of his courts, Edward III. raised\\r\\nthe salaries of his judges, and imposed upon them such oaths that none\\r\\nof their order could pervert justice, or even encourage venal practices,\\r\\nwithout breaking his solemn vow[13] to the king\\'s majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the amounts of the _royal_ fees or stipends paid to Edward III.\\'s\\r\\njudges, it may be vaguely estimated how far they were dependent on gifts\\r\\nand _court_ fees for the means of living with appropriate state. John\\r\\nKnyvet, Chief Justice of the King\\'s Bench, has £40 and 100 marks per\\r\\nannum. The annual fee of Thomas de Ingleby, the solitary puisne judge\\r\\nof the King\\'s Bench at that time, was at first 40 marks; but he obtained\\r\\nan additional £40 when the \\'fees\\' were raised, and he received moreover\\r\\n£20 a year as a judge of assize. The Chief of the Common Pleas, Robert\\r\\nde Thrope, received £40 per annum, payable during his tenure of office,\\r\\nand another annual sum of £40 payable during his life. John de Mowbray,\\r\\nWilliam de Wychingham, and William de Fyncheden, the other judges of the\\r\\nCommon Pleas, received 40 marks each as official salary, and £20 per\\r\\nannum for their services at assizes. Mowbray\\'s stipend was subsequently\\r\\nincreased by 40 marks, whilst Wychingham and Fyncheden received an\\r\\nadditional £40 par annum. To the Chief Baron and the other two Barons of\\r\\nthe Exchequer annual fees of 40 marks each were paid, the Chief Baron\\r\\nreceiving £20 per annum as Justice of Assize, and one of the puisne\\r\\nBarons, Almaric de Shirland, getting an additional 40 marks for certain\\r\\nspecial services. The \\'Issue Roll of 44 Edward III., 1370,\\' also shows\\r\\nthat certain sergeants-at-law acted as Justices of Assize, receiving for\\r\\ntheir service £20 per annum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout his reign Edward III. strenuously exerted himself to purge\\r\\nhis law courts of abuses, and to secure his subjects from evils wrought\\r\\nby judicial dishonesty; and though there is reason to think that he\\r\\nprosecuted his reforms, and punished offending judges with more\\r\\nimpulsiveness than consistency--with petulance rather than\\r\\nfirmness[14]--his action must have produced many beneficial results. But\\r\\nit does not seem to have occurred to him that the system adopted by his\\r\\npredecessors, and encouraged by the usages of his own time, was the\\r\\nreal source of the mischief, and that so long as judges received the\\r\\ngreater part of their remuneration from suitors, fees and the donations\\r\\nof the public, enactments and proclamations would be comparatively\\r\\npowerless to preserve the streams of justice from pollution. The\\r\\nfee-system poisoned the morality of the law-courts. From the highest\\r\\njudge to the lowest usher, every person connected with a court of\\r\\njustice was educated to receive small sums of money for trifling\\r\\nservices, to be always looking out for paltry dues or gratuities, to\\r\\nmultiply occasions for demanding, and reasons for pocketing petty coins,\\r\\nto invent devices for legitimate peculation. In time the system produced\\r\\nsuch complications of custom, right, privilege, claim, that no one could\\r\\nsay definitely how much a suitor was actually bound to pay at each stage\\r\\nof a suit. The fees had an equally bad influence on the public. Trained\\r\\nto approach the king\\'s judges with costly presents, to receive them on\\r\\ntheir visits with lavish hospitality, to send them offerings at the\\r\\nopening of each year, the rich and the poor learnt to look on judicial\\r\\ndecisions as things that were bought and sold. In many cases this\\r\\nimpression was not erroneous. Judges were forbidden to accept gifts from\\r\\nactual suitors, or to take payments _for_ judgments after their\\r\\ndelivery; but on the judgment-seat they were often influenced by\\r\\nrecollections of the conduct of suitors who _had been_ munificent before\\r\\nthe commencement of proceedings, and most probably would be equally\\r\\nmunificent six months after delivery of a judgment favorable to their\\r\\nclaims. Humorous anecdotes heightened the significance of patent facts.\\r\\nThroughout a shire it would be told how this suitor won a judgment by a\\r\\nsumptuous feast; how that suitor bought the justice\\'s favor with a flask\\r\\nof rare wine, a horse of excellent breed, a hound of superior sagacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fifteenth century the judge whose probity did not succumb to an\\r\\nexcellent dinner was deemed a miracle of virtue. \"A lady,\" writes Fuller\\r\\nof Chief Justice Markham, who was dismissed from his place in 1470,\\r\\n\"would traverse a suit of law against the will of her husband, who was\\r\\ncontented to buy his quiet by giving her her will therein, though\\r\\notherwise persuaded in his judgment the cause would go against her. This\\r\\nlady, dwelling in the shire town, invited the judge to dinner, and\\r\\n(though thrifty enough herself) treated him with sumptuous\\r\\nentertainment. Dinner being done, and the cause being called, the judge\\r\\ngave it against her. And when, in passion, she vowed never to invite the\\r\\njudge again, \\'Nay, wife,\\' said he, \\'vow never to invite a _just judge_\\r\\nany more.\\'\" It may be safely affirmed that no English lady of our time\\r\\never tried to bribe Sir Alexander Cockburn or Sir Frederick Pollock with\\r\\na dinner _à la Russe_.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy his eulogy of Chief Justice Dyer, who died March 24, 1582, Whetstone\\r\\ngives proof that in Elizabethan England purity was the exception rather\\r\\nthan the rule with judges:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"And when he spake he was in speeche reposde;\\r\\n     His eyes did search the simple suitor\\'s harte;\\r\\n   To put by bribes his hands were ever closde,\\r\\n     His processe juste, he tooke the poore man\\'s parte.\\r\\n     He ruld by lawe and listened not to arte,\\r\\n   Those foes to truthe--loove, hate, and private gain,\\r\\n   Which most corrupt, his conscience could not staine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no reason to suppose that the custom of giving and receiving\\r\\npresents was more general or extravagant in the time of Elizabeth than\\r\\nin previous ages; but the fuller records of her splendid reign give\\r\\ngreater prominence to the usage than it obtained in the chronicles of\\r\\nany earlier period of English history. On each New Year\\'s day her\\r\\ncourtiers gave her costly presents--jewels, ornaments of gold or silver\\r\\nworkmanship, hundreds of ounces of silver-gilt plate, tapestry, laces,\\r\\nsatin dresses, embroidered petticoats. Not only did she accept such\\r\\ncostly presents from men of rank and wealth, but she graciously received\\r\\nthe donations of tradesmen and menials. Francis Bacon made her majesty\\r\\n\"a poor oblation of a garment;\" Charles Smith, the dustman, threw upon\\r\\nthe pile of treasure \"two bottes of cambric.\" The fashion thus\\r\\ncountenanced by the queen was followed in all ranks of society; all men,\\r\\nfrom high to low, receiving presents, as expressions of affection when\\r\\nthey came from their equals, as declarations of respect when they came\\r\\nfrom their social inferiors. Each of her great officers of state drew a\\r\\nhandsome revenue from such yearly offerings. But though the burdens and\\r\\nabuses of this system were excessive under Elizabeth, they increased in\\r\\nenormity and number during the reigns of the Stuarts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the salaries of the Elizabethan judges were small in comparison\\r\\nwith the sums which they received in presents and fees may be seen from\\r\\nthe following Table of stipends and allowances annually paid, towards\\r\\nthe close of the sixteenth century:--\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                      £  _s._  _d._\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lord Cheefe Justice of England:--\\r\\n  Fee, Reward and Robes                              208   6     8\\r\\n  Wyne, 2 tunnes at £5 the tunne                      10   0     0\\r\\n  Allowance for being Justice of Assize               20   0     0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lord Cheefe Justice of the Common Pleas:--\\r\\n  Fee, Reward, and Robes                             141  13     4\\r\\n  Wyne, two tunnes                                     8   0     0\\r\\n  Allowance as Justice of Assize                      20   0     0\\r\\n  Fee for keeping the Assize in the Augmentation\\r\\n  Court                                               12  10     8\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of the three Justices in these two Courts:--\\r\\n  Fee, Reward and Robes                             £123   6_s._ 8_d._\\r\\n  Allowance as Justice of Assize                      20   0     0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lord Cheefe Baron of the Exchequer:--\\r\\n  Fee                                                100   0     0\\r\\n  Lyvery                                              12  17     8\\r\\n  Allowance as Justice of the Assize                  20   0     0\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of the three Barons:--\\r\\n  Fee                                                 46  12     4\\r\\n  Lyvery a peece                                      12  17     4\\r\\n  Allowance as Justice of Assize                      20   0     0\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to and in the earlier part of Elizabeth\\'s reign, the sheriffs had\\r\\nbeen required to provide diet and lodging for judges travelling on\\r\\ncircuit, each sheriff being responsible for the proper entertainment of\\r\\njudges within the limits of his jurisdiction. This arrangement was very\\r\\nburdensome upon the class from which the sheriffs were elected, as the\\r\\nofficial host had not only to furnish suitable lodging and cheer for the\\r\\njustices themselves, but also to supply the wants of their attendants\\r\\nand servants. The ostentatious and costly hospitality which law and\\r\\npublic opinion thus compelled or encouraged them to exercise towards\\r\\ncircuiteers of all ranks had seriously embarrassed a great number of\\r\\ncountry gentlemen; and the queen was assailed with entreaties for a\\r\\nreform that should free a sheriff of small estate from the necessity of\\r\\neither ruining himself, or incurring a reputation for stinginess. In\\r\\nconsequence of these urgent representations, an order of council,\\r\\nbearing date February 21, 1574, decided \"the justices shall have of her\\r\\nmajesty several sums of money out of her coffers for their daily diet.\"\\r\\nHence rose the usage of \\'circuit allowances.\\' The sheriffs, however,\\r\\nwere still bound to attend upon the judges, and make suitable provision\\r\\nfor the safe conduct of the legal functionaries from assize town to\\r\\nassize town;--the sheriff of each county being required to furnish a\\r\\nbody-guard for the protection of the sovereign\\'s representatives. This\\r\\nresponsibility lasted till the other day, when an innovation (of which\\r\\nMr. Arcedeckne, of Glevering Hall, Suffolk, was the most notorious,\\r\\nthough not the first champion), substituted guards of policemen, paid by\\r\\ncounty-rates, for bands of javelin-men equipped and rewarded by the\\r\\nsheriffs. In some counties the javelin-men--remote descendants of the\\r\\nmail-clad knights and stalwart men-at-arms who formerly mustered at the\\r\\nsummons of sheriffs--still do duty with long wands and fresh rosettes;\\r\\nbut they are fast giving way to the wielders of short staves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the bad consequences of the system of gratuities was the color\\r\\nwhich it gave to idle rumors and malicious slander against the purity of\\r\\nupright judges.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sir Thomas More fell, charges of bribery were preferred against him\\r\\nbefore the Privy Council. A disappointed suitor, named Parnell, declared\\r\\nthat the Chancellor had been bribed with a gift-cup to decide in favor\\r\\nof his (Parnell\\'s) adversary. Mistress Vaughan, the successful suitor\\'s\\r\\nwife, had given Sir Thomas the cup with her own hands. The fallen\\r\\nChancellor admitting that \"he had received the cup as a New Year\\'s\\r\\nGift,\" Lord Wiltshire cried, with unseemly exultation, \"Lo! did I not\\r\\ntell you, my lords, that you would find this matter true?\" It seemed\\r\\nthat More had pleaded guilty, for his oath did not permit him to receive\\r\\na New Year\\'s Gift from an actual suitor. \"But, my lords,\" continued the\\r\\naccused man, with one of his characteristic smiles, \"hear the other part\\r\\nof my tale. After having drunk to her of wine, with which my butler had\\r\\nfilled the cup, and when she had pledged me, I restored it to her, and\\r\\nwould listen to no refusal.\" It is possible that Mistress Vaughan did\\r\\nnot act with corrupt intention, but merely in ignorance of the rule\\r\\nwhich forbade the Chancellor to accept her present. As much cannot be\\r\\nsaid in behalf of Mrs. Croker, who, being opposed in a suit to Lord\\r\\nArundel, sought to win Sir Thomas More\\'s favor by presenting him with a\\r\\npair of gloves containing forty angels. With a courteous smile he\\r\\naccepted the gloves, but constrained her to take back the gold. The\\r\\ngentleness of this rebuff is charming; but the story does not tell more\\r\\nin favor of Sir Thomas than to the disgrace of the lady and the moral\\r\\ntone of the society in which she lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nReaders should bear in mind the part which New Year\\'s Gifts and other\\r\\ncustomary gratuities played in the trumpery charges against Lord Bacon.\\r\\nAdopting an old method of calumny, the conspirators against his fair\\r\\nfame represented that the gifts made to him, in accordance with ancient\\r\\nusage, were bribes. For instance Reynel\\'s ring, presented on New Year\\'s\\r\\nday, was so construed by the accusers; and in his comment upon the\\r\\ncharge, Bacon, who had inadvertently accepted the gift during the\\r\\nprogress of a suit, observes, \"This ring was received certainly\\r\\n_pendente lite_, and though it were at New Year\\'s tide, yet it was too\\r\\ngreat a value for a New Year\\'s Gift, though, as I take it, nothing near\\r\\nthe value mentioned in the articles.\" So also Trevor\\'s gift was a New\\r\\nYear\\'s present, of which Bacon says, \"I confess and declare that I\\r\\nreceived at New Year\\'s tide an hundred pounds from Sir John Trevor, and\\r\\nbecause it came as a New Year\\'s Gift, I neglected to inquire whether the\\r\\ncause was ended or depending; but since I find that though the cause was\\r\\nthen dismissed to a trial at law, yet the equity is reserved, so as it\\r\\nwas in that kind _pendente lite_.\" Bacon knew that this explanation\\r\\nwould be read by men familiar with the history of New Year\\'s Gifts, and\\r\\nall the circumstances of the ancient usage; and it is needless to say\\r\\nthat no man of honor thought the less highly of Bacon at that time,\\r\\nbecause his pure and guiltless acceptance of customary presents was by\\r\\ningenious and unscrupulous adversaries made to assume an appearance of\\r\\ncorrupt compliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow far the Chancellors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\\r\\ndepended upon customary gratuities for their revenues may be seen from\\r\\nthe facts which show the degree of state which they were required to\\r\\nmaintain, and the inadequacy of the ancient fees for the maintenance of\\r\\nthat pomp. When Elizabeth pressed Hatton for payment of the sums which\\r\\nhe owed her, the Chancellor lamented his inability to liquidate her just\\r\\nclaims, and urged in excuse that the _ancient fees_ were very inadequate\\r\\nto the expenses of the Chancellor\\'s office. But though Elizabethan\\r\\nChancellors could not live upon their ancient fees, they kept up palaces\\r\\nin town and country, fed regiments of lackeys, and surpassed the ancient\\r\\nnobility in the grandeur of their equipages. Egerton--the needy and\\r\\nillegitimate son of a rural knight, a lawyer who fought up from the\\r\\nranks--not only sustained the costly dignities of office, but left to\\r\\nhis descendants a landed estate worth £8000 per annum. Bacon\\'s successor\\r\\nin the \\'marble chair,\\' Lord Keeper Williams, assured Buckingham that in\\r\\nEgerton\\'s time the Chancellor\\'s lawful income was less than three\\r\\nthousand per annum. \"The lawful revenue of the office stands thus,\"\\r\\nwrote Williams, speaking from his intimate knowledge of Ellesmere\\'s\\r\\naffairs, \"or not much above it at anytime:--in fines certain, £1300 per\\r\\nannum, or thereabouts; in fines casual, £1250 or thereabouts; in greater\\r\\nwrits, £140; for impost of wine, £100--in all, £2790; and these are all\\r\\nthe true means of that great office.\" It is probable that Williams\\r\\nunder-stated the revenue, but it is certain that the income, apart from\\r\\ngratuities, was insufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chancellor was not more dependent on customary gratuities than the\\r\\nchief of the three Common Law courts. At Westminster and on circuit,\\r\\nwhenever he was required to discharge his official functions, the\\r\\nEnglish judge extended his hand for the contributions of the\\r\\nwell-disposed. No one thought of blaming judges for their readiness to\\r\\ntake customary benevolences. To take gifts was a usage of the\\r\\nprofession, and had its parallel in the customs of every calling and\\r\\nrank of life. The clergy took dues in like manner: from the earliest\\r\\ndays of feudal life the territorial lords had supplied their wants in\\r\\nthe same way; amongst merchants and yeomen, petty traders and servants,\\r\\nthe system existed in full force. These presents were made without any\\r\\nsecrecy. The aldermen of borough towns openly voted presents to the\\r\\njudges; and the judges received their offerings--not as benefactions,\\r\\nbut as legitimate perquisites. In 1620--just a year before Lord Bacon\\'s\\r\\nfall--the municipal council of Lyme Regis left it to the \"mayor\\'s\\r\\ndiscretion\" to decide \"what gratuity he will give to the Lord Chief\\r\\nBaron and his men\" at the next assizes. The system, it is needless to\\r\\nsay, had disastrous results. Empowering the chief judge of every court\\r\\nto receive presents not only from the public, but from subordinate\\r\\njudges, inferior officers, and the bar; and moreover empowering each\\r\\nplace-holder to take gratuities from persons officially or by profession\\r\\nconcerned in the business of the courts, it produced a complicated\\r\\nmachinery for extortion. By presents the chief justices bought their\\r\\nplaces from the crown or a royal favorite; by presents the puisne\\r\\njustices, registrars, counsel bought place or favor from the chief; by\\r\\npresents the attorneys, sub-registrars, and outside public sought to\\r\\ngain their ends with the humbler place-holders. The meanest ushers of\\r\\nWestminster Hall took coins from ragged scriveners. Hence every place\\r\\nwas actually bought and sold, the sum being in most cases very high.\\r\\nSir James Ley offered the Duke of Buckingham £10,000 for the Attorney\\'s\\r\\nplace. At the same period the Solicitor General\\'s office was sold for\\r\\n£4000. Under Charles I. matters grew still worse than they had been\\r\\nunder his father. When Sir Charles Cæsar consulted Laud about the worth\\r\\nof the vacant Mastership of the Rolls, the archbishop frankly said,\\r\\n\"that as things then stood, the place was not likely to go without more\\r\\nmoney than he thought any wise man would give for it.\" Disregarding this\\r\\nintimation, Sir Charles paid the king £15,000 for the place, and added a\\r\\nloan of £2000. Sir Thomas Richardson, at the opening of the reign, gave\\r\\n£17,000 for the Chiefship of the Common Pleas. If judges needed gifts\\r\\nbefore the days when vacant seats were put up to auction, of course they\\r\\nstood all the more in need of them when they bought their promotions\\r\\nwith such large sums. It is not wonderful that the wearers of ermine\\r\\nrepaid themselves by venal practices. The sale of judicial offices was\\r\\nnaturally followed by the sale of judicial decisions. The judges having\\r\\nsubmitted to the extortions of the king, the public had to endure the\\r\\nextortions of the judges. Corruption on the bench produced corruption at\\r\\nthe bar. Counsel bought the attention and compliance of \\'the court,\\' and\\r\\nin some cases sold their influence with shameless rascality. They would\\r\\ntake fees to speak from one side in a cause and fees to be silent from\\r\\nthe other side--selling their own clients as coolly as judges sold the\\r\\nsuitors of their courts. Sympathizing with the public, and stung by\\r\\npersonal experience of legal dishonesty, the clergy sometimes denounced\\r\\nfrom the pulpit the extortions of corrupt judges and unprincipled\\r\\nbarristers. The assize sermons of Charles I.\\'s reign were frequently\\r\\nseasoned with such animadversions. At Thetford Assizes, March, 1630,\\r\\nthe Rev. Mr. Ramsay, in the assize-sermon, spoke indignantly of judges\\r\\nwho \"favored causes,\" and of \"counsellors who took fees to be silent.\"\\r\\nIn the summer of 1631, at the Bury Assizes, \"one Mr. Scott made a sore\\r\\nsermon in discovery of corruption in judges and others.\" At Norwich, the\\r\\nsame authority, viz., \\'Sir John Rous\\'s Diary,\\' informs us--\"Mr. Greene\\r\\nwas more plaine, insomuch that Judge Harvey, in his charge, broke out\\r\\nthus: \\'It seems by the sermon that we are corrupt, but we know that we\\r\\ncan use conscience in our places as well as the best clergieman of\\r\\nall.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his \\'Life and Death of Sir Matthew Hale,\\' Bishop Burnet tells a good\\r\\nstory of the Chief\\'s conduct with regard to a customary gift. \"It is\\r\\nalso a custom,\" says the biographer, \"for the Marshall of the King\\'s\\r\\nBench to present the judges of that court with a piece of plate for a\\r\\nNew Year\\'s Gift, that for the Chief Justice being larger than the rest.\\r\\nThis he intended to have refused, but the other judges told him it\\r\\nbelonged to his office, and the refusing it would be a prejudice to his\\r\\nsuccessors; so he was persuaded to take it, but he sent word to the\\r\\nmarshall, that instead of plate he should bring him the value of it in\\r\\nmoney, and when he received it, he immediately sent it to the prisons\\r\\nfor the relief and discharge of the poor there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[13] A portion of the oath prescribed for judges in the \\'Ordinances for\\r\\nJustices,\\' 20 Edward III., will show the reader the evils which called\\r\\nfor correction and the care taken to effect their cure. \"Ye shall\\r\\nswear,\" ran the injunction to which each judge was required to vow\\r\\nobedience, \"that well and lawfully ye shall serve our lord the king and\\r\\nhis people in the office of justice; ... and that ye take not by\\r\\nyourself or by other, privily or apertly, gift or reward of gold or\\r\\nsilver, nor any other thing which may turn to your profit, unless it be\\r\\nmeat nor drink, and that of small value, _of any man that shall have\\r\\nplea or process before you, as long as the same process shall be so\\r\\nhanging, nor after for the same cause: and that ye shall take no fee as\\r\\nlong as ye shall be justice, nor robes of any man, great or small_, but\\r\\nof the king himself: and that ye give none advice or counsel to no man,\\r\\ngreat or small, in any case where the king is party; &c. &c. &c.\" The\\r\\nclause forbidding the judge to receive gifts of actual suitors was a\\r\\npositive recognition of his right to customary gifts rendered by persons\\r\\nwho had no process hanging before him. It should, moreover, be observed\\r\\nthat in the passage, \"ye shall take no fee as long as ye shall be\\r\\njustice, nor robes of any man,\" the word \"fee\" signifies \"salary,\" and\\r\\nnot a single payment or gratuity. The Judge was forbidden to receive\\r\\nfrom any man a fixed stipend (by the acceptance of which he would become\\r\\nthe donor\\'s servant), or robes (the assumption of which would be open\\r\\ndeclaration of service); but he was at liberty to accept the offerings\\r\\nwhich the public were wont to make to men of his condition, as well as\\r\\nthe sums (or \\'fees,\\' as they would be termed at the present day) due on\\r\\ndifferent processes of his court. That the word \\'fee\\' is thus used in\\r\\nthe ordinance may be seen from the words \"for this cause we have\\r\\nincreased the fees (les feez) of the same our justices, in such manner\\r\\nas it ought reasonably to suffice them,\" by which language attention is\\r\\ndrawn to the increase of judicial salaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n[14] Mr. Foss observes: \"In 1350, William de Thrope, Chief Justice of\\r\\nthe King\\'s Bench, was convicted on his own confession of receiving\\r\\nbribes to stay justice; but though his property was forfeited to the\\r\\nCrown on his condemnation, the king appears to have relented, and to\\r\\nhave made him second Baron of the Exchequer in May, 1352, unless I am\\r\\nmistaken in supposing the latter to have been the same person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV.\\r\\n\\r\\nGIFTS AND SALES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees the public ceased to make presents to the principal judges of\\r\\nthe kingdom; but long after the Chancellor and the three Chiefs had\\r\\ntaken the last offerings of general society, they continued to receive\\r\\nyearly presents from the subordinate judges, placemen, and barristers\\r\\nof their respective courts. Lord Cowper deserves honor for being the\\r\\nholder of the seals who, by refusing to pocket these customary\\r\\ndonations, put an end to a very objectionable system, so far as the\\r\\nCourt of Chancery was concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn being made Lord Keeper, he resolved to depart from the custom of his\\r\\npredecessors for many generations, who on the first day of each new year\\r\\nhad invariably entertained at breakfast the persons from whom tribute\\r\\nwas looked for. Very droll were these receptions in the old time. The\\r\\nrepast at an end, the guests forthwith disburdened themselves of their\\r\\ngold--the payers approaching the holder of the seals in order of rank,\\r\\nand laying on his table purses of money, which the noble payee accepted\\r\\nwith his own hands. Sometimes his lordship was embarrassed by a ceremony\\r\\nthat required him to pick gold from the fingers of men, several of whom\\r\\nhe knew to be in indigent circumstances. In Charles II.\\'s time it was\\r\\nobserved that the silver-tongued Lord Nottingham on such occasions\\r\\nalways endeavored to hide his confusion under a succession of nervous\\r\\nsmiles and exclamations--\"Oh, Tyrant Cuthtom!--Oh, Tyrant Cuthtom!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is noteworthy that in relinquishing the benefit of these exactions,\\r\\nthe Lord Keeper feared unfriendly criticism much more than he\\r\\nanticipated public commendation. In his diary, under date December 30,\\r\\nCowper wrote:--\"I acquainted my Lord Treasurer with my design to refuse\\r\\nNew Year\\'s Gifts, if he had no objection against it, as spoiling, in\\r\\nsome measure, a place of which he had the conferring. He answered it was\\r\\nnot expected of me, but that I might do as my predecessors had done; but\\r\\nif I refused, he thought nobody could blame me for it.\" Anxious about\\r\\nthe consequences of his innovation, the new Lord Keeper gave notice that\\r\\non January 1, 1705-6, he would receive no gifts; but notwithstanding\\r\\nthis proclamation, several officers of Chancery and counsellors came to\\r\\nhis house with tribute, and were refused admittance. \"New Year\\'s Gifts\\r\\nturned back,\" he wrote in his diary at the close of the eventful day,\\r\\n\"and pray God it doth me more credit and good than hurt, by making\\r\\nsecret enemies _in fæce Romuli_.\" His fears were in a slight degree\\r\\nfulfilled. The Chiefs of the three Common Law Courts were greatly\\r\\ndispleased with an innovation which they had no wish to adopt; and their\\r\\nwarm expressions of dissatisfaction induced the Lord Keeper to cover his\\r\\ndisinterestedness with a harmless fiction. To pacify the indignant\\r\\nChiefs and the many persons who sympathized with them, he pretended that\\r\\nthough he had declined intentionally the gifts of the Chancery\\r\\nbarristers, he had not designed to exercise the same self-denial with\\r\\nregard to the gifts of Chancery officers.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common law chiefs were slow to follow in the Lord Keeper\\'s steps,\\r\\nand many years passed before the reform, effected in Chancery by\\r\\naccident or design, or by a lucky combination of both, was adopted in\\r\\nthe other great courts. In his memoir of Lord Cowper, Campbell observes:\\r\\n\"His example with respect to New Year\\'s Gifts was not speedily followed;\\r\\nand it is said that till very recently the Chief Justice of the Common\\r\\nPleas invited the officers of his court to a dinner at the beginning of\\r\\nthe year, when each of them deposited under his plate a present in the\\r\\nshape of a Bank of England note, instead of a gift of oxen roaring at\\r\\nhis levee, as in ruder times.\" There is no need to remind the reader in\\r\\nthis place of the many veracious and the many apocryphal stories\\r\\nconcerning the basket justices of Fielding\\'s time--stories showing that\\r\\nin law courts of the lowest sort applicants for justice were accustomed\\r\\nto fee the judges with victuals and drink until a comparatively recent\\r\\ndate.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucky would it have been for the first Earl of Macclesfield if the\\r\\ncustom of selling places in Chancery had been put an end to forever by\\r\\nthe Lord Keeper who abolished the custom of New Year\\'s Gifts; but the\\r\\njudge who at the sacrifice of one-fourth of his official income swept\\r\\naway the pernicious usage which had from time immemorial marked the\\r\\nopening of each year, saw no reason why he should purge Chancery of\\r\\nanother scarcely less objectionable practice. Following the steps of\\r\\ntheir predecessors, the Chancellors Cowper, Harcourt, and Macclesfield\\r\\nsold subordinate offices in their court; and whereas all previous\\r\\nChancellors had been held blameless for so doing, Lord Macclesfield was\\r\\npunished with official degradation, fine, imprisonment, and obloquy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy birth as humble[16] as any layman who before or since his time has\\r\\nheld the seals, Thomas Parker raised himself to the woolsack by great\\r\\ntalents and honorable industry. As an advocate he won the respect of\\r\\nsociety and his profession; as a judge he ranks with the first\\r\\nexpositors of English law. Although for imputed corruption he was hurled\\r\\nwith ignominy from his high place, no one has ventured to charge him\\r\\nwith venality on the bench. That he was a spotless character, or that\\r\\nhis career was marked by grandeur of purpose, it would be difficult to\\r\\nestablish; but few Englishmen could at the present time be found to deny\\r\\nthat he was in the main an upright peer, who was not wittingly\\r\\nneglectful of his duty to the country which had loaded him with wealth\\r\\nand honors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the many persons ruined by the bursting of the South Sea Bubble\\r\\nwere certain Masters of Chancery, who had thrown away on that wild\\r\\nspeculation large sums of which they were the official guardians. Lord\\r\\nMacclesfield was one of the victims on whom the nation wreaked its wrath\\r\\nat a crisis when universal folly had produced universal disaster. To\\r\\npunish the masters for their delinquencies was not enough; greater\\r\\nsacrifices than a few comparatively obscure placemen were demanded by\\r\\nthe suitors and wards whose money had been squandered by the fraudulent\\r\\ntrustees. The Lord Chancellor should be made responsible for the\\r\\nChancery defalcations. That was the will of the country. No one\\r\\npretended that Lord Macclesfield had originated the practice which\\r\\npermitted Masters in Chancery to speculate with funds placed under their\\r\\ncare; attorneys and merchants were well aware that in the days of\\r\\nHarcourt, Cowper, Wright, and Somers, it had been usual for masters to\\r\\npocket interest accruing from suitors\\' money; notorious also was it\\r\\nthat, though the Chancellor was theoretically the trustee of the money\\r\\nconfided to his court, the masters were its actual custodians. Had the\\r\\nChancellor known that the masters were trafficking in dangerous\\r\\ninvestments to the probable loss of the public, duty would have required\\r\\nhim to examine their accounts and place all trust-moneys beyond their\\r\\nreach; but until the crash came, Lord Macclesfield knew neither the\\r\\nactual worthlessness of the South Sea Stock, nor the embarrassed\\r\\ncircumstances of the defaulting masters, nor the peril of the persons\\r\\ncommitted to his care. The system which permitted the masters to\\r\\nspeculate with money not their own was execrable, but the Lord\\r\\nChancellor was not the parent of that system.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfuriated by the national calamity, in which they were themselves great\\r\\nsufferers, the Commons impeached the Chancellor, charging him with high\\r\\ncrimes and misdemeanors, of which the peers unanimously declared him\\r\\nguilty. In this famous trial the great fact established against his\\r\\nlordship was that he had sold masterships to the defaulters. It appeared\\r\\nthat he had not only sold the places, but had stood out for very high\\r\\nprices; the inference being, that in consideration of these large sums\\r\\nhe had left the purchasers without the supervision usually exercised by\\r\\nChancellors over such officers, and had connived at the practices which\\r\\nhad been followed by ruinous results. To this it was replied, that if\\r\\nthe Chancellor had sold the places at higher prices than his\\r\\npredecessors, he had done so because the places had become much more\\r\\nvaluable; that at the worst he had but sold them to the highest bidder,\\r\\nafter the example of his precursors; that the inference was not\\r\\nsupported by any direct testimony.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery humorous was some of the evidence by which the sale of the\\r\\nmasterships was proved. Master Elde deposed that he bought his office\\r\\nfor 5000 guineas, the bargain being finally settled and fulfilled after\\r\\na personal interview with the accused lord. Master Thurston, another\\r\\npurchaser at the high rate of 5000 guineas, paid his money to Lady\\r\\nMacclesfield. It must be owned that these sums were very large, but\\r\\ntheir magnitude does not fix fraudulent purpose upon the Chancellor.\\r\\nThat he believed himself fairly entitled to a moderate present on\\r\\nappointing to a mastership is certain; that he regarded £2000 as the\\r\\ngratuity which he might accept, without blushing at its publication, may\\r\\nbe inferred from the restitution of £3250 which he made to one of the\\r\\npurchasers for £5250 at a time when he anticipated an inquiry into his\\r\\nconduct; that he felt himself acting indiscreetly if not wrongfully in\\r\\npressing for such large sums is testified by the caution with which he\\r\\nconferred with the purchasers and the secrecy with which he accepted\\r\\ntheir money.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis defence before the peers admitted the sales of the places, but\\r\\nmaintained that the transactions were legitimate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defence was of no avail. When the question of guilty or not guilty\\r\\nwas put to the peers, each of the noble lords present answered, \"Guilty,\\r\\nupon my honor.\" Sentenced to pay a fine of £30,000, and undergo\\r\\nimprisonment until the mulct was paid, the unfortunate statesman\\r\\nbitterly repented the imprudence which had exposed him to the vengeance\\r\\nof political adversaries and to the enmity of the vulgar. Whilst the\\r\\npassions roused by the prosecution were at their height, the fallen\\r\\nChancellor was treated with much harshness by Parliament, and with\\r\\nactual brutality by the mob. Ever ready to vilify lawyers, the rabble\\r\\nseized on so favorable an occasion for giving expression to one of their\\r\\nstrongest prejudices. Amongst the crowds who followed the Earl to the\\r\\nTower with curses, voices were heard to exclaim that \"Staffordshire had\\r\\nproduced the three greatest scoundrels of England--Jack Sheppard,\\r\\nJonathan Wilde, and Tom Parker.\" Jonathan Wilde was executed in\\r\\n1725--the year of Lord Macclesfield\\'s impeachment; and Jack Sheppard\\r\\ndied on the gallows at Tyburn, November 16, 1724.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the inquiry, and after the adverse verdict, George I.\\r\\npersisted in showing favor to the disgraced Chancellor; and when the\\r\\nviolent emotions of the crisis had passed away it was generally admitted\\r\\nby enlightened critics of public events that Lord Macclesfield had been\\r\\nunfairly treated. The scape-goat of popular wrath, he suffered less for\\r\\nhis own faults, than for the evil results of a bad system; and at the\\r\\npresent time--when the silence of more than a hundred and thirty years\\r\\nrests upon his tomb--Englishmen, with one voice, acknowledge the\\r\\nvaluable qualities that raised him to eminence, and regret the\\r\\nproceedings which consigned him in his old age to humiliation and gloom.\\r\\n\\r\\n[15] It should be observed that many persons are of opinion that the\\r\\nLord Keeper\\'s assertion on this point was not an artifice, but a simple\\r\\nstatement of fact. To those who take this view, his lordship\\'s position\\r\\nseems alike ridiculous and respectable--respectable because he actually\\r\\nintended to forbear from taking the barrister\\'s money; ridiculous\\r\\nbecause, through clumsy and inadequate arrangements, he missed the other\\r\\nand not less precious gifts which he did not mean to decline. Anyhow,\\r\\nthe critics admit that credit is due to him for persisting in a\\r\\nchange--wrought in the first instance partly by honorable design and\\r\\npartly by accident.\\r\\n\\r\\n[16] The cases of John Scott, Philip Yorke, and Edward Sugden are before\\r\\nthe mind of the present writer, when he pens the sentence to which this\\r\\nnote refers. The social extraction of the English bar will be considered\\r\\nin a later chapter of this work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA ROD PICKLED BY WILLIAM COLE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A proneness to take bribes may be generated from the habit of taking\\r\\nfees,\" said Lord Keeper Williams in his Inaugural Address, making an\\r\\nungenerous allusion to Francis Bacon, whilst he uttered a statement\\r\\nwhich was no calumny upon King James\\'s Bench and Bar, though it is\\r\\nsignally inapplicable to lawyers of the present day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Williams, tradition preserves a story that illustrates the prevalence\\r\\nof judicial corruption in the seventeenth century, and the jealousy with\\r\\nwhich that Right Reverend Lord Keeper watched for attempts to tamper\\r\\nwith his honesty. Whilst he was taking exercise in the Great Park of\\r\\nNonsuch House, his attention was caught by a church recently erected at\\r\\nthe cost of a rich Chancery suitor. Having expressed satisfaction with\\r\\nthe church, Williams inquired of George Minors, \"Has he not a suit\\r\\ndepending in Chancery?\" and on receiving an answer in the affirmative,\\r\\nobserved, \"he shall not fare the worse for building of churches.\" These\\r\\nwords being reported to the pious suitor, he not illogically argued that\\r\\nthe Keeper was a judge likely to be influenced in making his decisions\\r\\nby matters distinct from the legal merits of the case put before him.\\r\\nActing on this impression, the good man forthwith sent messengers to\\r\\nNonsuch House, bearing gifts of fruits and poultry to the holder of the\\r\\nseals. \"Nay, carry them back,\" cried the judge, looking with a grim\\r\\nsmile from the presents to George Minors; \"nay, carry them back, George,\\r\\nand tell your friend that he shall not fare the better for sending of\\r\\npresents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRich in satire directed against law and its professors, the literature\\r\\nof the Commonwealth affords conclusive testimony of the low esteem in\\r\\nwhich lawyers were held in the seventeenth century by the populace, and\\r\\nshows how universal was the belief that wearers of ermine and gentlemen\\r\\nof the long robe would practice any sort of fraud or extortion for the\\r\\nsake of personal advantage. In the pamphlets and broadsides, in the\\r\\nsquibs and ballads of the period, may be found a wealth of quaint\\r\\nnarrative and broad invective, setting forth the rascality of judges and\\r\\nattorneys, barristers and scriveners. Any literary effort to throw\\r\\ncontempt upon the law was sure of success. The light jesters, who made\\r\\nmerry with the phraseology and costumes of Westminster Hall, were only a\\r\\nfew degrees less welcome than the stronger and more indignant scribes\\r\\nwho cried aloud against the sins and sinners of the courts. When simple\\r\\nfolk had expended their rage in denunciations of venal eloquence and\\r\\nunjust judgments, they amused themselves with laughing at the antiquated\\r\\nverbiage of the rascals who sought to conceal their bad morality under\\r\\nworse Latin. \\'A New Modell, or the Conversion of the Infidell Terms of\\r\\nthe Law: For the Better promoting of misunderstanding according to\\r\\nCommon Sense,\\' is a publication consisting of a cover or fly-leaf and\\r\\ntwo leaves, that appeared about a year before the Restoration. The wit\\r\\nis not brilliant; its humor is not free from uncleanness; but its comic\\r\\nrenderings[17] of a hundred law terms illustrate the humor of the\\r\\ntimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore serious in aim, but not less comical in result, is William Cole\\'s\\r\\n\\'A Rod for the Lawyers. London, Printed in the year 1659.\\' The preface\\r\\nof this mad treatise ends thus--\"I do not altogether despair but that\\r\\nbefore I dye I may see the Inns of Courts, or dens of Thieves, converted\\r\\ninto Hospitals, which were a rare piece of justice; that as they\\r\\nformerly have immured those that robbed the poor of houses, so they may\\r\\nat last preserve the poor themselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother book touching on the same subject and belonging to the same\\r\\nperiod, is, \\'Sagrir, or Doomsday drawing nigh; With Thunder and\\r\\nLightning to Lawyers, (1653) by John Rogers.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nViolent, even for a man holding Fifth-Monarchy views, John Rogers\\r\\nprefers a lengthy indictment against lawyers, for whose delinquencies\\r\\nand heinous offence he admits neither apology nor palliation. In his\\r\\nopinion all judges deserve the death of Arnold and Hall, whose last\\r\\nmoments were provided for by the hangman. The wearers of the long robe\\r\\nare perjurers, thieves, enemies of mankind; their institutions are\\r\\nhateful, and their usages abominable. In olden time they were less\\r\\npowerful and rapacious. But prosperity soon exaggerated all their evil\\r\\nqualities. Sketching the rise of the profession, the author\\r\\nobserves--\"These men would get sometimes Parents, Friends, Brothers,\\r\\nNeighbors, sometimes _others_ to be (in their absence) Agents, Factors,\\r\\nor Solicitors for them at Westminster, and as yet they had no stately\\r\\nhouses or mansions to live in, as they have now (called Inns of Court),\\r\\nbut they lodged like countrymen or strangers in ordinary Inns. But\\r\\nafterwards, when the interests of lawyers began to look big (as in\\r\\nEdward III.\\'s days), they got mansions or colleges, which they called\\r\\nInns, and by the king\\'s favor had an addition of honor, whence they were\\r\\ncalled Inns of Court.\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe familiar anecdotes which are told as illustrations of Chief Justice\\r\\nHale\\'s integrity are very ridiculous, but they serve to show that the\\r\\njudges of his time were believed to be very accessible to corrupt\\r\\ninfluences. During his tenure of the Chiefship of the Exchequer, Hale\\r\\nrode the Western Circuit, and met with the loyal reception usually\\r\\naccorded to judges on circuit in his day. Amongst other attentions\\r\\noffered to the judges on this occasion was a present of venison from a\\r\\nwealthy gentleman who was concerned in a cause that was in due course\\r\\ncalled for hearing. No sooner was the call made than Chief Baron Hale\\r\\nresolved to place his reputation for judicial honesty above suspicion,\\r\\nand the following scene occurred:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Lord Chief Baron._--\\'Is this plaintiff the gentleman of the same name\\r\\nwho hath sent me the venison?\\' _Judge\\'s servant._--\\'Yes, please you, my\\r\\nlord.\\' _Lord Chief Baron._--\\'Stop a bit, then. Do not yet swear the\\r\\njury. I cannot allow the trial to go on till I have paid him for his\\r\\nbuck!\\' _Plaintiff._--\\'I would have your lordship to know that neither\\r\\nmyself nor my forefathers have ever sold venison, and I have done\\r\\nnothing to your lordship which we have not done to every judge that has\\r\\ncome this circuit for centuries bygone.\\' _Magistrate of the\\r\\nCounty._--\\'My lord, I can confirm what the gentleman says for truth, for\\r\\ntwenty years back.\\' _Other Magistrates._--\\'And we, my lord, know the\\r\\nsame.\\' _Lord Chief Baron._--\\'That is nothing to me. The Holy Scripture\\r\\nsays, \\'A gift perverteth the ways of judgment.\\' I will not suffer the\\r\\ntrial to go on till the venison is paid for. Let my butler count down\\r\\nthe full value thereof.\\' _Plaintiff._--\\'I will not disgrace myself and\\r\\nmy ancestors by becoming a venison butcher. From the needless dread of\\r\\n_selling_ justice, your lordship _delays_ it. I withdraw my record.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as good taste and dignity were concerned, the gentleman of the\\r\\nWest Country was the victor in this absurd contest: on the other hand,\\r\\nHale had the venison for nothing, and was relieved of the trouble of\\r\\nhearing the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same manner Hale insisted on paying for six loaves of sugar which\\r\\nthe Dean and Chapter of Salisbury sent to his lodgings, in accordance\\r\\nwith ancient usage. Similar cases of the judge\\'s readiness to construe\\r\\ncourtesies as bribes may be found in notices of trials and books of\\r\\n_ana_.\\r\\n\\r\\n_A propos_ of these stories of Hale\\'s squeamishness, Lord Campbell tells\\r\\nthe following good anecdote of Baron Graham: \"The late Baron Graham\\r\\nrelated to me the following anecdote to show that he had more firmness\\r\\nthan Judge Hale:--\\'There was a baronet of ancient family with whom the\\r\\njudges going the Western Circuit had always been accustomed to dine.\\r\\nWhen I went that circuit I heard that a cause, in which he was\\r\\nplaintiff, was coming on for trial: but the usual invitation was\\r\\nreceived, and lest the people might suppose that judges could be\\r\\ninfluenced by a dinner; I accepted it. The defendant, a neighboring\\r\\nsquire, being dreadfully alarmed by this intelligence, said to himself,\\r\\n\\'Well, if Sir John entertains the judge hospitably, I do not see why I\\r\\nshould not do the same by the jury.\\' So he invited to dinner the whole\\r\\nof the special jury summoned to try the cause. Thereupon the baronet\\'s\\r\\ncourage failed him, and he withdrew the record, so that the cause was\\r\\nnot tried; and although I had my dinner, I escaped all suspicion of\\r\\npartiality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story puts the present writer in mind of another story which he has\\r\\nheard told in various ways, the wit of it being attributed by different\\r\\nnarrators to two judges who have left the bench for another world, and a\\r\\nMaster of Chancery who is still alive. On the present occasion the\\r\\nMaster of Chancery shall figure as the humorist of the anecdote.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess than twenty years since, in one of England\\'s southern counties, two\\r\\nneighboring landed proprietors differed concerning their respective\\r\\nrights over some unenclosed land, and also about certain rights of\\r\\nfishing in an adjacent stream. The one proprietor was the richest\\r\\nbaronet, the other the poorest squire of the county; and they agreed to\\r\\nsettle their dispute by arbitration. Our Master in Chancery, slightly\\r\\nknown to both gentlemen, was invited to act as arbitrator after\\r\\ninspecting the localities in dispute. The invitation was accepted and\\r\\nthe master visited the scene of disagreement, on the understanding that\\r\\nhe should give up two days to the matter. It was arranged that on the\\r\\nfirst day he should walk over the squire\\'s estate, and hear the squire\\'s\\r\\nuncontradicted version of the case, dining at the close of the day with\\r\\nboth contendents at the squire\\'s table; and that on the second day,\\r\\nhaving walked over the baronet\\'s estate, and heard without interruption\\r\\nthe other side of the story, he should give his award, sitting over wine\\r\\nafter dinner at the rich man\\'s table. At the close of the first day the\\r\\nsquire entertained his wealthy neighbor and the arbitrator at dinner.\\r\\nIn accordance with the host\\'s means, the dinner was modest but\\r\\nsufficient. It consisted of three fried soles, a roast leg of mutton,\\r\\nand vegetables; three pancakes, three pieces of cheese, three small\\r\\nloaves of bread, ale, and a bottle of sherry. On the removal of the\\r\\nviands, three magnificent apples, together with a magnum of port, were\\r\\nplaced on the table by way of dessert. At the close of the second day\\r\\nthe trio dined at the baronet\\'s table, when it appeared that, struck by\\r\\nthe simplicity of the previous day\\'s dinner, and rightly attributing the\\r\\nabsence of luxuries to the narrowness of the host\\'s purse, the wealthy\\r\\ndisputant had resolved not to attempt to influence the umpire by giving\\r\\nhim a superior repast. Sitting at another table the trio dined on\\r\\nexactly the same fare,--three fried soles, a roast leg of mutton, and\\r\\nvegetables; three pancakes, three pieces of cheese, three small loaves\\r\\nof bread, ale, and a bottle of sherry; and for dessert three magnificent\\r\\napples, together with a magnum of port. The dinner being over, the\\r\\napples devoured, and the last glass of port drunk, the arbitrator (his\\r\\neyes twinkling brightly as he spoke) introduced his award with the\\r\\nfollowing exordium:--\"Gentlemen, I have with all proper attention\\r\\nconsidered your _sole_ reasons: I have taken due notice of your _joint_\\r\\nreasons, and I have come to the conclusion that your _des(s)erts_ are\\r\\nabout equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[17] Of these renderings the subjoined may be taken as favorable\\r\\nspecimens:--\"Breve originale, original sinne; capias, a catch to a sad\\r\\ntune; alias capias, another to the same (sad tune); habeas corpus, a\\r\\ntrooper; capias ad satisfaciend., a hangman: latitat, bo-peep; nisi\\r\\nprius, first come first served; demurrer, hum and haw; scandal. magnat.,\\r\\ndown with the Lords.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[18] Even vacations stink in the nostrils of Mr. Rogers; for he\\r\\nmaintains that they are not so much periods when lawyers cease from\\r\\ntheir odious practices, as times of repose and recreation wherein they\\r\\ngain fresh vigor and daring for the commission of further outrages, and\\r\\nallow their unhappy victims to acquire just enough wealth to render them\\r\\nworth the trouble of despoiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHIEF JUSTICE POPHAM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the strangest cases of corruption amongst English Judges still\\r\\nremains to be told on the slender authority which is the sole foundation\\r\\nof the weighty accusation. In comparatively recent times there have not\\r\\nbeen many eminent Englishmen to whom \\'tradition\\'s simple tongue\\' has\\r\\nbeen more hostile than Queen Elizabeth\\'s Lord Chief Justice, Popham. The\\r\\nyounger son of a gentle family, John Popham passed from Oxford to the\\r\\nMiddle Temple, raised himself to the honors of the ermine, secured the\\r\\nadmiration of illustrious contemporaries, in his latter years gained\\r\\nabundant praise for wholesome severity towards footpads, and at his\\r\\ndeath left behind him a name--which, tradition informs us, belonged to a\\r\\nman who in his reckless youth, and even after his call to the bar, was a\\r\\ncut-purse and highwayman. In mitigation of his conduct it is urged by\\r\\nthose who credit the charge, that young gentlemen of his date were so\\r\\nmuch addicted to the lawless excitement of the road, that when he was\\r\\nstill a beardless stripling, an act (1 Ed. VI. c. 12, s. 14) was passed,\\r\\nwhereby any peer of the realm or lord of parliament, on a first\\r\\nconviction for robbery, was entitled to benefit of clergy, though he\\r\\ncould not read. But bearing in mind the liberties which rumor is wont to\\r\\ntake with the names of eminent persons, the readiness the multitude\\r\\nalways display to attribute light morals to grave men, and the\\r\\ninfrequency of the cases where a dissolute youth is the prelude to a\\r\\nmanhood of strenuous industry and an old age of honor--the cautious\\r\\nreader will require conclusive testimony before he accepts Popham\\'s\\r\\nconnection with \\'the road\\' as one of the unassailable facts of history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authority for this grave charge against a famous judge is John\\r\\nAubrey, the antiquary, who was born in 1627, just twenty years after\\r\\nPopham\\'s death. \"For severall yeares,\" this collector says of the Chief\\r\\nJustice, \"he addicted himself but little to the studie of the lawes, but\\r\\nprofligate company, and was wont to take a purse with them. His wife\\r\\nconsidered her and his condition, and at last prevailed with him to\\r\\nlead another life and to stick to the studie of the lawe, which, upon\\r\\nher importunity, he did, being then about thirtie yours old.\" As Popham\\r\\nwas born in 1531, he withdrew, according to this account, from the\\r\\ncompany of gentle highwaymen about the year 1561--more than sixty years\\r\\nbefore Aubrey\\'s birth, and more than a hundred years before the\\r\\ncollector committed the scandalous story to writing. The worth of such\\r\\ntestimony is not great. Good stories are often fixed upon eminent men\\r\\nwho had no part in the transactions thereby attributed to them. If this\\r\\nwriter were to put into a private note-book a pleasant but unauthorized\\r\\nanecdote imputing _kleptomania_ to Chief Justice Wiles (who died in\\r\\n1761), and fifty years hence the note-book should be discovered in a\\r\\ndirty corner of a forgotten closet and published to the world--would\\r\\nreaders in the twentieth century be justified in holding that Sir John\\r\\nWilles was an eccentric thief?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Aubrey tells a still stranger story concerning Popham, when he sets\\r\\nforth the means by which the judge made himself lord of Littlecote Hall\\r\\nin Wiltshire. The case must be given in the narrator\\'s own words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir Richard Dayrell of Littlecot in com. Wilts. having got his lady\\'s\\r\\nwaiting-woman with child, when her travell came sent a servant with a\\r\\nhorse for a midwife, whom he was to bring hoodwinked. She was brought,\\r\\nand layd the woman; but as soon as the child was born, she saw the\\r\\nknight take the child and murther it, and burn it in the fire in the\\r\\nchamber. She having done her business was extraordinarily rewarded for\\r\\nher paines, and went blindfold away. This horrid action did much run in\\r\\nher mind, and she had a desire to discover it, but knew not where \\'twas.\\r\\nShe considered with herself the time she was riding, and how many miles\\r\\nshe might have rode at that rate in that time, and that it must be some\\r\\ngreat person\\'s house, for the roome was twelve foot high: and she\\r\\nshould know the chamber if she sawe it. She went to a justice of peace,\\r\\nand search was made. The very chamber found. The knight was brought to\\r\\nhis tryall; and, to be short, this judge had this noble house, park, and\\r\\nmanor, and (I think) more, for a bribe to save his life. Sir John Popham\\r\\ngave sentence according to lawe, but being a great person and a\\r\\nfavorite, he procured a _nolle prosequi_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ghastly tale of crime following upon crime has been reproduced by\\r\\nlater writers with various exaggerations and modifications. Dramas and\\r\\nnovels have been founded upon it; and a volume might be made of the\\r\\nballads and songs to which it has given birth. In some versions the\\r\\ncorrupt judge does not even go through the form of passing sentence, but\\r\\nsecures an acquittal from the jury; according to one account, the\\r\\nmother, instead of the infant, was put to death; according to another,\\r\\nthe erring woman was the murderer\\'s daughter, instead of his wife\\'s\\r\\nwaiting-woman; another writer, assuming credit as a conscientious\\r\\nnarrator of facts, places the crime in the eighteenth instead of the\\r\\nsixteenth century, and transforms the venal judge into a clever\\r\\nbarrister.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a highly seasoned statement of the repulsive tradition communicated\\r\\nby Lord Webb Seymour to Walter Scott, the murder is described with\\r\\nhideous minuteness.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging the midwife into \\'a Friar of orders grey,\\' and murdering the\\r\\nmother instead of the baby, Sir Walter Scott revived the story in one of\\r\\nhis most popular ballads. But of all the versions of the tradition that\\r\\nhave come under this writer\\'s notice, the one that departs most widely\\r\\nfrom Aubrey\\'s statement is given in Mr. G.L. Rede\\'s \\'Anecdotes and\\r\\nBiography,\\' (1799).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nJUDICIAL SALARIES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the last three hundred years the law has been a lucrative\\r\\nprofession, our great judges during that period having in many instances\\r\\nleft behind them large fortunes, earned at the bar or acquired from\\r\\nofficial emoluments. The rental of Egerton\\'s landed estates was £8,000\\r\\nper annum--a royal income in the days of Elizabeth and James. Maynard\\r\\nleft great wealth to his grand-daughters, Lady Hobart and Mary Countess\\r\\nof Stamford. Lord Mansfield\\'s favorite investment was mortgage; and\\r\\ntowards the close of his life the income which he derived for moneys\\r\\nlent on sound mortgages was £30,000 per annum. When Lord Kenyon had lost\\r\\nhis eldest son, he observed to Mr. Justice Allan Park--\"How delighted\\r\\nGeorge would be to take his poor brother from the earth and restore him\\r\\nto life, although he receives £250,000 by his decease.\" Lord Eldon is\\r\\nsaid to have left to his descendants £500,000; and his brother, Lord\\r\\nStowell, to whom we are indebted for the phrase \\'the elegant simplicity\\r\\nof the Three per Cents.,\\' also acquired property that at the time of his\\r\\ndeath yielded £12,000 per annum.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Stowell\\'s personalty was sworn under £230,000, and he had invested\\r\\nconsiderable sums in land. It is noteworthy that this rich lawyer did\\r\\nnot learn to be contented with the moderate interest of the Three per\\r\\nCents. until he had sustained losses from bad speculations. Notable also\\r\\nis it that this rich lawyer--whose notorious satisfaction with three per\\r\\ncent. interest has gained for him a reputation of noble indifference to\\r\\ngain--was inordinately fond of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese great fortunes were raised from fees taken in practice at the\\r\\nbar, from judicial salaries or pensions, and from other official\\r\\ngains--such as court dues, perquisites, sinecures, and allowances. Since\\r\\nthe Revolution of 1688 these last named irregular or fluctuating sources\\r\\nof judicial income have steadily diminished, and in the present day have\\r\\ncome to an end. Eldon\\'s receipts during his tenure of the seals cannot\\r\\nbe definitely stated, but more is known about them and his earnings at\\r\\nthe bar than he intended the world to discover, when he declared in\\r\\nParliament \"that in no one year, since he had been made Lord Chancellor,\\r\\nhad he received the same amount of profit which he enjoyed while at the\\r\\nbar.\" Whilst he was Attorney General he earned something more than\\r\\n£10,000 a year; and in returns which he himself made to the House of\\r\\nCommons, he admits that in 1810 he received, as Lord Chancellor, a gross\\r\\nincome of £22,730, from which sum, after deduction of all expenses,\\r\\nthere remained a net income of £17,000 per annum. He was enabled also to\\r\\nenrich the members of his family with presentations to offices, and\\r\\nreversions of places.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil comparatively recent times, judges were dangerously dependent on\\r\\nthe king\\'s favor; for they not only held their offices during the\\r\\npleasure of the crown, but on dismissal they could not claim a retiring\\r\\npension. In the seventeenth century, an aged judge, worn out by toil and\\r\\nlength of days, was deemed a notable instance of royal generosity, if he\\r\\nobtained a small allowance on relinquishing his place in court. Chief\\r\\nJustice Hale, on his retirement, was signally favored when Charles II.\\r\\ngraciously promised to continue his salary till the end of his\\r\\nlife--which was manifestly near its close. Under the Stuarts, the judges\\r\\nwho lost their places for courageous fidelity to law, were wont to\\r\\nresume practice at the bar. To provide against the consequences of\\r\\nejection from office, great lawyers, before they consented to exchange\\r\\nthe gains of advocacy for the uncertain advantages of the woolsack, used\\r\\nto stipulate for special allowance--over and above the ancient\\r\\nemoluments of place. Lord Nottingham had an allowance of £4000 per\\r\\nannum; and Lord Guildford, after a struggle for better times, was\\r\\nconstrained, at a cost of mental serenity, to accept the seals, with a\\r\\nspecial salary of half that sum.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1688 down to the present time, the chronicler of changes in the\\r\\nlegal profession, has to notice a succession of alterations in the\\r\\nsystem and scale of judicial payments--all of the innovations having a\\r\\ntendency to raise the dignity of the bench. Under William and Mary, an\\r\\nallowance (still continued), was made to holders of the seal on their\\r\\nappointment, for the cost of outfit and equipages. The amount of this\\r\\nspecial aid was £2000, but fees reduced it to £1843 13_s._ Mr. Foss\\r\\nobserves--\"The earliest existing record of this allowance, is dated June\\r\\n4, 1700, when Sir Nathan Wright was made Lord Keeper, which states it to\\r\\nbe the same sum as had been allowed to his predecessor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same period, the salary of a puisne judge was but £1000 a year--a\\r\\nsum that would have been altogether insufficient for his expenses. A\\r\\nconsiderable part of a puisne\\'s remuneration consisted of fees,\\r\\nperquisites, and presents. Amongst the customary presents to judges at\\r\\nthis time, may be mentioned the _white gloves_, which men convicted of\\r\\nmanslaughter, presented to the judges when they pleaded the king\\'s\\r\\npardon; the _sugar loaves_, which the Warden of the Fleet annually sent\\r\\nto the judges of the Common Pleas; and the almanacs yearly distributed\\r\\namongst the occupants of the bench by the Stationers\\' Company. From one\\r\\nof these almanacs, in which Judge Rokeby kept his accounts, it appears\\r\\nthat in the year 1694, the casual profits of his place amounted to £694,\\r\\n4_s._ 6_d._ Here is the list of his official incomes, (net) for ten\\r\\nyears:--in 1689, £1378, 10_s._; in 1690, £1475, 10_s._ 10_d._; in 1691,\\r\\n£2063, 18_s._ 4_d._; in 1692, £1570, 1_s._ 4_d._; in 1693, £1569, 13_s._\\r\\n1_d._; in 1694, £1629, 4_s._ 6_d._; in 1695, £1443, 7_s._ 6_d._; in\\r\\n1696, £1478, 2_s._ 6_d._; in 1697, £1498, 11_s._ 11_d._; in 1698, £1631,\\r\\n10_s._ 11_d._ The fluctuation of the amounts in this list, is worthy of\\r\\nobservation; as it points to one bad consequence of the system of paying\\r\\njudges by fees, gratuities, and uncertain perquisites. A needy judge,\\r\\nwhose income in lucky years was over two thousand pounds, must have been\\r\\nsadly pinched in years when he did not receive fifteen hundred.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the heading, \"The charges of my coming into my judge\\'s place, and\\r\\nthe taxes upon it the first yeare and halfe,\" Judge Rokeby gives the\\r\\nfollowing particulars:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"1689, May 11. To Mr. Milton, Deputy Clerk of the Crown, as per note,\\r\\nfor the patent and swearing privately, £21, 6_s._ 4_d._ May 30. To Mr.\\r\\nEnglish, charges of the patent at the Secretary of State\\'s Office, as\\r\\nper note, said to be a new fee, £6, 10_s._ Inrolling the patent in\\r\\nExchequer and Treasury, £2, 3_s._ 4_d._ Ju. 27.

Evelyn, not a very reliable authority, but still a chronicler\\r\\nworthy of notice even on questions of fact, says:--\"Oct. 1705. Mr.\\r\\nCowper made Lord Keeper. Observing how uncertain greate officers are of\\r\\ncontinuing long in their places, he would not accept it unless £2,000 a\\r\\nyeare were given him in reversion when he was put out, in consideration\\r\\nof his loss of practice. His predecessors, how little time soever they\\r\\nhad the seal, usually got £100,000, and made themselves barons.\" It is\\r\\ndoubtful whether this bargain was actually made; but long after\\r\\nCowper\\'s time, lawyers about to mount the woolsack, insisted on having\\r\\nterms that should compensate them for loss of practice. Lord\\r\\nMacclesfield had a special salary of £4000 per annum, during his\\r\\noccupancy of the marble chair, and obtained a grant of £12,000 from the\\r\\nking;--a tellership in the Exchequer being also bestowed upon his eldest\\r\\nson. Lord King obtained even better terms--a salary of £6000 per annum\\r\\nfrom the Post Office, and £1200 from the Hanaper Office; this large\\r\\nincome being granted to him in consideration of the injury done to the\\r\\nChancellor\\'s emoluments by the proceedings against Lord\\r\\nMacclesfield--whereby it was declared illegal for chancellors to sell\\r\\nthe subordinate offices in the Court of Chancery. This arrangement--giving\\r\\nthe Chancellor an increased salary in _lieu_ of the sums which he could\\r\\nno longer raise by sales of offices--is conclusive testimony that in\\r\\nthe opinion of the crown Lord Macclesfield had a right to sell the\\r\\nmasterships. The terms made by Lord Northington, in 1766, on\\r\\nresigning the Seals and becoming President of the Council, illustrate\\r\\nthis custom. On quitting the marble chair, he obtained an immediate\\r\\npension of £2000 per annum; and an agreement that the annual payment\\r\\nshould be made £4000 per annum, as soon as he retired from the\\r\\nPresidency: he also obtained a reversionary grant for two lives of the\\r\\nlucrative office of Clerk of the Hanaper in Chancery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Lord Chancellor King\\'s time, amongst the fees and perquisites which\\r\\nhe wished to regulate and reform were the supplies of stationery,\\r\\nprovided by the country for the great law-officers. It may be supposed\\r\\nthat the sum thus expended on paper, pens, and wax was an insignificant\\r\\nitem in the national expenditure; but such was not the case--for the\\r\\nchief of the courts were accustomed to place their personal friends on\\r\\nthe free-list for articles of stationery. The Archbishop of Dublin, a\\r\\ndignitary well able to pay for his own writing materials, wrote to Lord\\r\\nKing, April 10, 1733: \"MY LORD,--Ever since I had the honor of being\\r\\nacquainted with Lord Chancellors, I have lived in England and Ireland\\r\\nupon Chancery paper, pens, and wax. I am not willing to lose an old\\r\\nadvantageous custom. If your Lordship hath any to spare me by my\\r\\nservant, you will oblige your very humble servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"JOHN DUBLIN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo long as judges or subordinate officers were paid by casual\\r\\nperquisites and fees, paid directly to them by suitors, a taint of\\r\\ncorruption lingered in the practice of our courts. Long after judges\\r\\nceased to sell injustice, they delayed justice from interested motives,\\r\\nand when questions concerning their perquisites were raised, they would\\r\\nsometimes strain a point, for the sake of their own private advantage.\\r\\nEven Lord Ellenborough, whose fame is bright amongst the reputations of\\r\\nhonorable men, could not always exercise self-control when attempts were\\r\\nmade to lessen his customary profits, \"I never,\" writes Lord Campbell,\\r\\n\"saw this feeling at all manifest itself in Lord Ellenborough except\\r\\nonce, when a question arose whether money paid into court was liable to\\r\\npoundage. I was counsel in the case, and threw him into a furious\\r\\npassion, by strenuously resisting the demand; the poundage was to go\\r\\ninto his own pocket--being payable to the chief clerk--an office held in\\r\\ntrust for him. If he was in any degree influenced by this consideration,\\r\\nI make no doubt that he was wholly unconscious of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge III.\\'s reign witnessed the introduction of changes long required,\\r\\nand frequently demanded in the mode and amounts of judicial payments. In\\r\\n1779, puisne judges and barons received an additional £400 per annum,\\r\\nand the Chief Baron an increase of £500 a year. Twenty years later,\\r\\nStat. 39, Geo. III., c. 110, gave the Master of the Rolls, £4000 a\\r\\nyear, the Lord Chief Baron £4000 a year, and each of the puisne judges\\r\\nand barons, £3000 per annum. By the same act also, life-pensions of\\r\\n£4000 per annum were secured to retiring holders of the seal, and it was\\r\\nprovided that after fifteen years of service, or in case of incurable\\r\\ninfirmity, the Chief Justice of the King\\'s Bench could claim, on\\r\\nretirement, £3000 per annum, the Master of the Rolls, Chief of Common\\r\\nPleas, and Chief Baron £2500 per annum, and each minor judge of those\\r\\ncourts or Baron of the coif, £2000 a year. In 1809, (49 Geo. III., c.\\r\\n127) the Lord Chief Baron\\'s annual salary was raised to £5000; whilst a\\r\\nyearly stipend of £4000 was assigned to each puisne judge or baron. By\\r\\n53 Geo. III., c. 153, the Chiefs and Master of the Rolls, received on\\r\\nretirement an additional yearly £800, and the puisnes an additional\\r\\nyearly £600. A still more important reform of George III.\\'s reign was\\r\\nthe creation of the first Vice Chancellor in March, 1813. Rank was\\r\\nassigned to the new functionary next after the Master of the Rolls, and\\r\\nhis salary was fixed at £5000 per annum.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the reign of George IV. judges continued to take fees and\\r\\nperquisites; but by 6 Geo. IV. c. 82, 83, 84, it was arranged that the\\r\\nfees should be paid into the Exchequer, and that the undernamed great\\r\\nofficers of justice should receive the following salaries and pensions\\r\\non retirement:--\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                         An. Pension\\r\\n                                           An. Sal.    on retirement.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Chief Justice of King\\'s Bench        £10,000             £4000\\r\\nLord Chief Justice of Common Pleas           8000              3750\\r\\nThe Master of the Rolls                      7000              3750\\r\\nThe Vice Chancellor of England               6000              3750\\r\\nThe Chief Baron of the Exchequer             7000              3750\\r\\nEach Puisne Baron or Judge                   5500              3500\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover by this Act, the second judge of the King\\'s Bench was\\r\\nentitled, as in the preceding reign, to £40 for giving charge to the\\r\\ngrand jury in each term, and pronouncing judgment on malefactors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe changes with regard to judicial salaries under William IV. were\\r\\ncomparatively unimportant. By 2 and 3 Will. IV. c. 116, the salaries of\\r\\npuisne judges and barons were reduced to £5000 a year; and by 2 and 3\\r\\nWill. IV. c. 111, the Chancellor\\'s pension, on retirement, was raised to\\r\\n£5000, the additional £1000 per annum being assigned to him in\\r\\ncompensation of loss of patronage occasioned by the abolition of certain\\r\\noffices. These were the most noticeable of William\\'s provisions with\\r\\nregard to the payment of his judges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present reign, which has generously given the country two new\\r\\njudges, called Lord Justices, two additional Vice Chancellors, and a\\r\\nswarm of paid justices, in the shape of county court judges and\\r\\nstipendiary magistrates, has exercised economy with regard to judicial\\r\\nsalaries. The annual stipends of the two Chief Justices, fixed in 1825\\r\\nat £10,000 for the Chief of the King\\'s Bench, and £8000 for the Chief of\\r\\nthe Common Pleas, have been reduced, in the former case to £8000 per\\r\\nannum, in the latter to £7000 per annum. The Chancellor\\'s salary for his\\r\\nservices as Speaker of the House of Lords, has been made part of the\\r\\n£10,000 assigned to his legal office; so that his income is no more than\\r\\nten thousand a year. The salary of the Master of the Rolls has been\\r\\nreduced from £7000 to £6000 a year; the same stipend, together with a\\r\\npension on retirement of £3750, being assigned to each of the Lords\\r\\nJustices. The salary of a Vice Chancellor is £5000 per annum; and after\\r\\nfifteen years\\' service, or in case of incurable sickness, rendering him\\r\\nunable to discharge the functions of his office, he can retire with a\\r\\npension of £3500.\\r\\n\\r\\nThurlow had no pension on retirement; but with much justice Lord\\r\\nCampbell observes: \"Although there was no parliamentary retired\\r\\nallowance for ex-Chancellors, they were better off than at present.\\r\\nThurlow was a Teller of the Exchequer, and had given sinecures to all\\r\\nhis relations, for one of which his nephew now receives a commutation of\\r\\n£9000 a year.\" Lord Loughborough was the first ex-Chancellor who\\r\\nenjoyed, on retirement, a pension of £4000 per annum, under Stat. 39\\r\\nGeo. III. c. 110. The next claimant for an ex-Chancellor\\'s pension was\\r\\nEldon, on his ejection from office in 1806; and the third claimant was\\r\\nErskine, whom the possession of the pension did not preserve from the\\r\\nhumiliation of indigence.\\r\\n\\r\\nEldon\\'s obstinate tenacity of office, was attended with one good result.\\r\\nIt saved the nation much money by keeping down the number of\\r\\nex-Chancellors entitled to £4000 per annum. The frequency with which\\r\\nGovernments have been changed during the last forty years has had a\\r\\ncontrary effect, producing such a strong bevy of lawyers--who are\\r\\npensioners as well as peers--that financial reformers are loudly asking\\r\\nif some scheme cannot be devised for lessening the number of these\\r\\ncostly and comparatively useless personages. At the time when this page\\r\\nis written, there are four ex-Chancellors in receipt of pensions--Lords\\r\\nBrougham, St. Leonards, Cranworth, and Westbury; but death has recently\\r\\ndiminished the roll of Chancellors by removing Lords Truro and\\r\\nLyndhurst. Not long since the present writer read a very able, but\\r\\none-sided article in a liberal newspaper that gave the sum total spent\\r\\nby the country since Lord Eldon\\'s death in ex-Chancellors\\' pensions; and\\r\\nin simple truth it must be admitted that the bill was a fearful subject\\r\\nfor contemplation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[19] During the Commonwealth, the people, unwilling to pay their judges\\r\\nliberally, decided that a thousand a year was a sufficient income for a\\r\\nLord Commissioner of the Great Seal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART IV.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOSTUME AND TOILET.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nBRIGHT AND SAD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the days of the Conqueror\\'s Chancellor, Baldrick, who is reputed to\\r\\nhave invented and christened the sword-belt that bears his name, lawyers\\r\\nhave been conspicuous amongst the best dressed men of their times. For\\r\\nmany generations clerical discipline restrained the members of the bar\\r\\nfrom garments of lavish costliness and various colors, unless high rank\\r\\nand personal influence placed them above the fear of censure and\\r\\npunishment; but as soon as the law became a lay-profession, its\\r\\nmembers--especially those who were still young--eagerly seized the\\r\\nnewest fashions of costume, and expended so much time and money on\\r\\npersonal decoration, that the governors of the Inns deemed it expedient\\r\\nto make rules, with a view to check the inordinate love of gay apparel.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy these enactments, foppish modes of dressing the hair was\\r\\ndiscountenanced or forbidden, not less than the use of gaudy clothes and\\r\\nbright arms. Some of these regulations have a quaint air to readers of\\r\\nthis generation; and as indications of manners in past times, they\\r\\ndeserve attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Dugdale\\'s \\'Origines Juridiciales,\\' it appears that in the earlier\\r\\npart of Henry VIII.\\'s reign, the students and barristers of the Inns\\r\\nwere allowed great licence in settling for themselves minor points of\\r\\ncostume; but before that paternal monarch died, this freedom was\\r\\nlessened. Accepting the statements of a previous chronicler, Dugdale\\r\\nobserves of the members of the Middle Temple under Henry--\"They have no\\r\\norder for their apparell; but every man may go as him listeth, so that\\r\\nhis apparell pretend no lightness or wantonness in the wearer; for, even\\r\\nas his apparell doth shew him to be, even so he shall be esteemed among\\r\\nthem.\" But at the period when this licence was permitted in respect of\\r\\ncostume, the general discipline of the Inn was scandalously lax; the\\r\\nvery next paragraph of the \\'Origines\\' showing that the templars forbore\\r\\nto shut their gates at night, whereby \"their chambers were oftentimes\\r\\nrobbed, and many other misdemeanors used.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut measures were taken to rectify the abuses and evil manners of the\\r\\nschools. In the thirty-eighth year of Henry VIII. an order was made\\r\\n\"that the gentlemen of this company\" (_i.e._, the Inner Temple) \"should\\r\\nreform themselves in their cut or disguised apparel, and not to have\\r\\nlong beards. And that the Treasurer of this society should confer with\\r\\nthe other Treasurers of Court for an uniform reformation.\" The\\r\\nauthorities of Lincoln\\'s Inn had already bestirred themselves to reduce\\r\\nthe extravagances of dress and toilet which marked their younger and\\r\\nmore frivolous fellow-members. \"And for decency in Apparel,\" writes\\r\\nDugdale, concerning Lincoln\\'s Inn, \"at a council held on the day of the\\r\\nNativity of St. John the Baptist, 23 Hen. VIII. it was ordered that for\\r\\na continual rule, to be thenceforth kept in this house, no gentleman,\\r\\nbeing a fellow of this house, should wear any cut or pansid hose, or\\r\\nbryches; or pansid doublet, upon pain of putting out of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTen years later the authorities of Lincoln\\'s Inn (33 Hen. VIII.) ordered\\r\\nthat no member of the society \"being in commons, or at his repast,\\r\\nshould wear a beard; and whoso did, to pay double commons or repasts in\\r\\nthis house during such time as he should have any beard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy an order of 5 Maii, 1 and 2 Philip and Mary, the gentlemen of the\\r\\nInner Temple were forbidden to wear long beards, no member of the\\r\\nsociety being permitted to wear a beard of more than three weeks\\'\\r\\ngrowth. Every breach of this law was punished by the heavy fine of\\r\\ntwenty shillings. In 4 and 5 of Philip and Mary it was ordered that no\\r\\nmember of the Middle Temple \"should thenceforth wear any great bryches\\r\\nin their hoses, made after the Dutch, Spanish, or Almon fashion; or\\r\\nlawnde upon their capps; or cut doublets, upon pain of iiis iiiid\\r\\nforfaiture for the first default, and the second time to be expelled the\\r\\nhouse.\" At Lincoln\\'s Inn, \"in 1 and 2 Philip and Mary, one Mr Wyde, of\\r\\nthis house, was (by special order made upon Ascension day) fined at five\\r\\ngroats, for going in his study gown in Cheapside, on a Sunday, about ten\\r\\no\\'clock before noon; and in Westminister Hall, in the Term time, in the\\r\\nforenoon.\" Mr. Wyde\\'s offence was one of remissness rather than of\\r\\nexcessive care for his personal appearance. With regard to beards in the\\r\\nsame reign Lincoln\\'s Inn exacted that such members \"as had beards should\\r\\npay 12_d._ for every meal they continued them; and every man\" was\\r\\nrequired \"to be shaven upon pain of putting out of commons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orders made under Elizabeth with regard to the same or similar\\r\\nmatters are even more humorous and diverse. At the Inner Temple \"it was\\r\\nordered in 36 Elizabeth (16 Junii), that if any fellow in commons, or\\r\\nlying in the Louse, did wear either hat or cloak in the Temple Church,\\r\\nhall, buttry, kitchen, or at the buttry-barr, dresser, or in the garden,\\r\\nhe should forfeit for every such offence vis viiid. And in 42 Eliz. (8\\r\\nFebr.) that they go not in cloaks, hatts, bootes, and spurs into the\\r\\ncity, but when they ride out of the town.\" This order was most\\r\\ndispleasing to the young men of the legal academies, who were given to\\r\\nswaggering amongst the brave gallants of city ordinaries, and delighted\\r\\nin showing their rich attire at Paul\\'s. The Templar of the Inner Temple\\r\\nwho ventured to wear arms (except his dagger) in hall committed a grave\\r\\noffence, and was fined five pounds. \"No fellow of this house should come\\r\\ninto the hall\" it was enacted at the Inner Temple, 38 Eliz. (20 Dec.)\\r\\n\"with any weapons, except his dagger, or his knife, upon pain of\\r\\nforfeiting the sum of five pounds.\" In old time the lawyers often\\r\\nquarrelled and drew swords in hall; and the object of this regulation\\r\\ndoubtless was to diminish the number of scandalous affrays. The Middle\\r\\nTemple, in 26 Eliz., made six prohibitory rules with regard to apparel,\\r\\nenacting, \"1. That no ruff should be worn. 2. Nor any White color in\\r\\ndoublets or hoses. 3. Nor any facing of velvet in gownes, but by such as\\r\\nwere of the bench. 4. That no gentleman should walk in the streets in\\r\\ntheir cloaks, but in gownes. 5. That no hat, or long, or curled hair be\\r\\nworn. 6. Nor any gown, but such as were of a sad color.\" Of similar\\r\\norders made at Gray\\'s Inn, during Elizabeth\\'s reign, the following edict\\r\\nof 42 Eliz. (Feb. 11) may be taken as a specimen:--\"That no gentleman of\\r\\nthis society do come into the hall, to any meal, with their hats, boots,\\r\\nor spurs; but with their caps, decently and orderly, according to the\\r\\nancient order of this house: upon pain, for every offence, to forfeit\\r\\niiis 4d, and for the third offence expulsion. Likewise, that no\\r\\ngentleman of this society do go into the city, or suburbs, or to walk in\\r\\nthe Fields, otherwise than in his gown, according to the ancient usage\\r\\nof the gentlemen of the Inns of Court, upon penalty of iiis iiiid for\\r\\nevery offence; and for the third, expulsion and loss of his chamber.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Lincoln\\'s Inn it was enacted, \"in 38 Eliz., that if any Fellow of\\r\\nthis House, being a commoner or repaster, should within the precinct of\\r\\nthis house wear any cloak, boots and spurs, or long hair, he should pay\\r\\nfor every offence five shillings for a fine, and also to be put out of\\r\\ncommons.\" The attempt to put down beards at Lincoln\\'s Inn failed.\\r\\nDugdale says, in his notes on that Inn, \"And in 1 Eliz. it was further\\r\\nordered, that no fellow of this house should wear any beard above a\\r\\nfortnight\\'s growth; and that whoso transgresses therein should for the\\r\\nfirst offence forfeit 3_s._ 4d., to be paid and cast with his commons;\\r\\nand for the second time 6_s_ 8d., in like manner to be paid and cast with\\r\\nhis commons; and the third time to be banished the house. But the\\r\\nfashion at that time of wearing beards grew then so predominant, as that\\r\\nthe very next year following, at a council held at this house, upon the\\r\\n27th of November, it was agreed and ordered, that all orders before that\\r\\ntime touching beards should be void and repealed.\" In the same year in\\r\\nwhich the authorities of Lincoln\\'s Inn forbade the wearing of beards,\\r\\nthey ordered that no fellow of their society \"should wear any sword or\\r\\nbuckler; or cause any to be born after him into the town.\" This was the\\r\\nfirst of the seven orders made in 1 Eliz. for _all_ the Inns of Court;\\r\\nof which orders the sixth runs thus:--\"That none should wear any velvet\\r\\nupper cap, neither in the house nor city. And that none after the first\\r\\nday of January then ensuing, should wear any furs, nor any manner of\\r\\nsilk in their apparel, otherwise than he could justifie by the stature\\r\\nof apparel, made _an._ 24 H. 8, under the penalty aforesaid.\" In the\\r\\neighth year of the following reign it was ordained at Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\n\"that no rapier should be worn in this house by any of the society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOther orders made in the reign of James I., and similar enactments\\r\\npassed by the Inns in still more recent periods, can be readily found on\\r\\nreference to Dugdale and later writers upon the usages of lawyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such matters, however, fashion is all-powerful; and however grandly\\r\\nthe benchers of an Inn might talk in their council-chamber, they could\\r\\nnot prevail on their youngsters to eschew beards when beards were the\\r\\nmode, or to crop the hair of their heads when long tresses were worn by\\r\\ngallants at court. Even in the time of Elizabeth--when authority was\\r\\nmost anxious that utter-barristers should in matters of costume maintain\\r\\nthat reputation for \\'sadness\\' which is the proverbial characteristic of\\r\\napprentices of the law--counsellors of various degrees were conspicuous\\r\\nthroughout the town for brave attire. If we had no other evidence\\r\\nbearing on the point, knowledge of human nature would make us certain\\r\\nthat the bar imitated Lord Chancellor Hatton\\'s costume. At Gray\\'s Inn,\\r\\nFrancis Bacon was not singular in loving rich clothes, and running into\\r\\ndebt for satin and velvet, jewels and brocade, lace and feathers. Even\\r\\nof that contemner of frivolous men and vain pursuits, Edward Coke,\\r\\nbiography assures us, \"The jewel of his mind was put into a fair case, a\\r\\nbeautiful body with comely countenance; a case which he did wipe and\\r\\nkeep clean, delighting in good clothes, well worn; being wont to say\\r\\nthat the outward neatness of our bodies might be a monitor of purity to\\r\\nour souls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courts of James I. and his son drew some of their most splendid fops\\r\\nfrom the multitude of young men who were enjoined by the elders of their\\r\\nprofession to adhere to a costume that was a compromise between the garb\\r\\nof an Oxford scholar and the guise of a London \\'prentice. The same was\\r\\nthe case with Charles II.\\'s London. Students and barristers outshone the\\r\\nbrightest idlers at Whitehall, whilst within the walls of their Inns\\r\\nbenchers still made a faint show of enforcing old restrictions upon\\r\\ncostume. At a time when every Templar in society wore hair--either\\r\\nnatural or artificial--long and elaborately dressed, Sir William Dugdale\\r\\nwrote, \"To the office of the chief butler\" (_i.e._, of the Middle\\r\\nTemple) \"it likewise appertaineth to take the names of those that be\\r\\nabsent at the said solemn revells, and to present them to the bench, as\\r\\nalso inform the bench of such as wear hats, bootes, _long hair_, or the\\r\\nlike (for the which he is commonly out of the young gentlemen\\'s favor).\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX.\\r\\n\\r\\nMILLINERY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSaith Sir William Dugdale, in his chapter concerning the personal attire\\r\\nof judges--\"That peculiar and decent vestments have, from great\\r\\nantiquity, been used in religious services, we have the authority of\\r\\nGod\\'s sacred precept to Moses, \\'_Thou shall make holy rayments for Aaron\\r\\nand his sons, that are to minister unto me, that they may be for glory\\r\\nand beauty_.\\'\" In this light and flippant age there are men irreverent\\r\\nenough to smile at the habiliments which our judges wear in court, for\\r\\nthe glory of God and the seemly embellishment of their own natural\\r\\nbeauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the stuff-gown of the utter-barrister, the robes of English judges\\r\\nare of considerable antiquity; but antiquaries labor in vain to discover\\r\\nall the facts relating to their origin and history. Mr. Foss says that\\r\\nat the Stuart Restoration English judges resumed the robes worn by their\\r\\npredecessors since the time of Edward I.; but though the judicial robes\\r\\nof the present day bear a close resemblance to the vestments worn by\\r\\nthat king\\'s judges, the costume of the bench has undergone many\\r\\nvariations since the twentieth year of his reign.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eleventh year of Richard II. a distinction was made between the\\r\\ncostumes of the chiefs of the King\\'s Bench and Common Pleas and their\\r\\nassistant justices; and at the same time the Chief Baron\\'s inferiority\\r\\nto the Chief Justices was marked by costume.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry VI.\\'s Chief Justice of the King\\'s Bench, Sir John Fortescue, in\\r\\nhis delightful treatise \\'De Laudibus Legum Angliæ,\\' describes the\\r\\nceremony attending the creation of a justice, and minutely sets forth\\r\\nthe chief items of judicial costume in the Bench and Common Pleas during\\r\\nhis time. \"Howbeit,\" runs Robert Mulcaster\\'s rendering of the \\'De\\r\\nLaudibus,\\' \"the habite of his rayment, hee shall from time to time\\r\\nforwarde, in some pointes change, but not in all the ensignments\\r\\nthereof. For beeing serjeaunt at lawe, hee was clothed in a long robe\\r\\npriestlyke, with a furred cape about his shoulders, and thereupon a\\r\\nhoode with two labels such as Doctours of the Lawes use to weare in\\r\\ncertayne universityes, with the above described quoyfe. But being once\\r\\nmade a justice, in steede of his hoode, hee shall weare a cloake cloased\\r\\nupon his righte shoulder, all the other ornaments of a serjeant still\\r\\nremayning; sauing that a justyce shall weare no partye coloured vesture\\r\\nas a serjeant may. And his cape is furred with none other than menever,\\r\\nwhereas the serjeant\\'s cape is ever furred with whyte lambe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJudicial costume varied with the fashion of the day or the whim of the\\r\\nsovereign in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Subsequent\\r\\ngenerations saw the introduction of other changes; and in the time of\\r\\nCharles I. questions relating to the attire of the common law judges\\r\\nwere involved in so much doubt, and surrounded with so many\\r\\ncontradictory precedents and traditions, that the judges resolved to\\r\\nsimplify matters by conference and unanimous action. The result of their\\r\\ndeliberation was a decree, dated June 6, 1635, to which Sir John\\r\\nBramston, Chief of the King\\'s Bench, Sir John Finch, Chief of the Common\\r\\nPleas, Sir Humphrey Davenport, Chief of the Exchequer, and all the minor\\r\\njudges of the three courts, gave subscription.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nWIGS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe changes effected in judicial costume during the Commonwealth, like\\r\\nthe reformation introduced at the same period into the language of the\\r\\nlaw, were all reversed in 1660, when Charles II.\\'s judges resumed the\\r\\nattire and usages of their predecessors in the first Charles\\'s reign.\\r\\nWhen he had satisfied himself that monarchical principles were sure of\\r\\nan enduring triumph, and that their victory would conduce to his own\\r\\nadvantage, great was young Samuel Pepys\\'s delight at seeing the ancient\\r\\ncustoms of the lawyers restored, one after another. In October, 1660, he\\r\\nhad the pleasure of seeing \"the Lord Chancellor and all the judges\\r\\nriding on horseback, and going to Westminster Hall, it being the first\\r\\nday of term.\" In the February of 1663-4 his eyes were gladdened by the\\r\\nrevival of another old practice. \"28th (Lord\\'s Day). Up and walked to\\r\\nSt. Paul\\'s,\" he writes, \"and, by chance, it was an extraordinary day for\\r\\nthe Readers of Inns of the Court and all the Students to come to church,\\r\\nit being an old ceremony not used these twenty-five years, upon the\\r\\nfirst Sunday in Lent. Abundance there was of students, more than there\\r\\nwas room to seat but upon forms, and the church mighty full. One Hawkins\\r\\npreached, an Oxford man, a good sermon upon these words, \\'But the wisdom\\r\\nfrom above is first pure, then peaceable.\\'\" Hawkins was no doubt a\\r\\nhumorist, and smiled in the sleeve of his Oxford gown as he told the\\r\\nlaw-students that _peace_ characterized the highest sort of _wisdom_.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, notwithstanding their zeal in reviving old customs, the lawyers of\\r\\nthe Restoration introduced certain novelties into legal life. From Paris\\r\\nthey imported the wig which still remains one of the distinctive\\r\\nadornments of the English barrister; and from the same centre of\\r\\ncivilization they introduced certain refinements of cookery, which had\\r\\nbeen hitherto unknown in the taverns of Fleet Street and the Strand. In\\r\\nthe earlier part of the \\'merry monarch\\'s\\' reign, the eating-house most\\r\\npopular with young barristers and law-students was kept by a French cook\\r\\nnamed Chattelin, who, besides entertaining his customers with delicate\\r\\nfare and choice wine, enriched our language with the word \\'cutlet\\'--in\\r\\nhis day spelt costelet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the seventeenth century, until wigs were generally adopted, the\\r\\ncommon law judges, like their precursors for several past generations,\\r\\nwore in court velvet caps, coifs, and cornered caps. Pictures preserve\\r\\nto us the appearance of justices, with their heads covered by one or two\\r\\nof these articles of dress, the moustache in many instances adorning the\\r\\nlip, and a well-trimmed beard giving point to the judicial chin. The\\r\\nmore common head-dress was the coif and coif-cap, of which it is\\r\\nnecessary to say a few words.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coif was a covering for the head, made of white lawn or silk, and\\r\\ncommon law judges wore it as a sign that they were members of the\\r\\nlearned brotherhood of sergeants. Speaking of the sergeants, Fortescue,\\r\\nin his \\'De Laudibus,\\' says--\"Wherefore to this state and degree hath no\\r\\nman beene hitherto admitted, except he hath first continued by the space\\r\\nof sixteene years in the said generall studio of the law, and in token\\r\\nor signe, that all justices are thus graduat, every one of them alwaies,\\r\\nwhile he sitteth in the Kinge\\'s Courts, weareth a white quoyfe of silke;\\r\\nwhich is the principal and chiefe insignment of habite, wherewith\\r\\nserjeants-at-lawe in their creation are decked. And neither the justice,\\r\\nnor yet the serjeaunt, shall ever put off the quoyfe, no not in the\\r\\nkinge\\'s presence, though he bee in talke with his majestie\\'s highnesse.\"\\r\\nAt times it was no easy matter to take the coif from the head; for the\\r\\nwhite drapery was fixed to its place with strings, which in the case of\\r\\none notorious rascal were not untied without difficulty. In Henry III.\\'s\\r\\nreign, when William de Bossy was charged in open court with corruption\\r\\nand dishonesty, he claimed the benefit of clerical orders, and\\r\\nendeavored to remove his coif in order that he might display his\\r\\ntonsure; but before he could effect his purpose, an officer of the court\\r\\nseized him by the throat and dragged him off to prison. \"Voluit,\" says\\r\\nMatthew Paris, \"ligamenta coifæ suæ solvere, ut, palam monstraret se\\r\\ntonsuram habere clericalem; sed non est permissus. Satelles vero eum\\r\\narripiens, non per coifæ ligamina sed per guttur eum apprehendens,\\r\\ntraxit ad carcerem.\" From which occurrence Spelman drew the untenable,\\r\\nand indeed, ridiculous inference, that the coif was introduced as a\\r\\nveil, beneath which ecclesiastics who wished to practice as judges or\\r\\ncounsel in the secular courts, might conceal the personal mark of their\\r\\norder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coif-cap is still worn in undiminished proportions by judges when\\r\\nthey pass sentence of death, and is generally known as the \\'black cap.\\'\\r\\nIn old time the justice, on making ready to pronounce the awful words\\r\\nwhich consigned a fellow-creature to a horrible death, was wont to draw\\r\\nup the flat, square, dark cap, that sometimes hung at the nape of his\\r\\nneck or the upper part of his shoulder. Having covered the whiteness of\\r\\nhis coif, and partially concealed his forehead and brows with the sable\\r\\ncloth, he proceeded to utter the dread sentence with solemn composure\\r\\nand firmness. At present the black cap is assumed to strike terror into\\r\\nthe hearts of the vulgar; formerly it was pulled over the eyes, to hide\\r\\nthe emotion of the judge.\\r\\n\\r\\nShorn of their original size, the coif and the coif-cap may still be\\r\\nseen in the wigs worn by sergeants at the present day. The black blot\\r\\nwhich marks the crown of a sergeant\\'s wig is generally spoken of as his\\r\\ncoif, but this designation is erroneous. The black blot is the coif-cap;\\r\\nand those who wish to see the veritable coif must take a near view of\\r\\nthe wig, when they will see that between the black silk and the\\r\\nhorsehair there lies a circular piece of white lawn, which is the\\r\\nvestige of that pure raiment so reverentially mentioned by Fortescue. On\\r\\nthe general adoption of wigs, the sergeants, like the rest of the bar,\\r\\nfollowed in the wake of fashion: but at first they wore their old coifs\\r\\nand caps over their false hair. Finding this plan cumbersome, they\\r\\ngradually diminished the size of the ancient covering, until the coif\\r\\nand cap became the absurd thing which resembles a bald place covered\\r\\nwith court-plaster quite as much as the rest of the wig resembles human\\r\\nhair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the common law judges of the seventeenth century, before the\\r\\nintroduction of wigs, wore the undiminished coif and coif-cap, the Lord\\r\\nChancellor, like the Speaker of the House of Commons, wore a hat. Lord\\r\\nKeeper Williams, the last clerical holder of the seals, used to wear in\\r\\nthe Court of Chancery a round, conical hat. Bradshaw, sitting as\\r\\npresident of the commissioners who tried Charles I., wore a hat instead\\r\\nof the coif and cap which he donned at other times as a serjeant of law.\\r\\nKennett tells us that \"Mr. Sergeant Bradshaw, the President, was afraid\\r\\nof some tumult upon such new and unprecedented insolence as that of\\r\\nsitting judge upon his king; and therefore, beside other defence, he had\\r\\na thick big-crowned beaver hat, lined with plated steel, to ward off\\r\\nblows.\" It is scarcely credible that Bradshaw resorted to such means for\\r\\nsecuring his own safety, for in the case of a tumult, a hat, however\\r\\nstrong, would have been an insignificant protection against popular\\r\\nfury. If conspirators had resolved to take his life, they would have\\r\\ntried to effect their purpose by shooting or stabbing him, not by\\r\\nknocking him on the head. A steel-plated hat would have been but a poor\\r\\nguard against a bludgeon, and a still poorer defence against poignard or\\r\\npistol. It is far more probable that in laying aside the ordinary\\r\\nhead-dress of an English common law judge, and in assuming a\\r\\nhigh-crowned hat, the usual covering of a Speaker, Bradshaw endeavored\\r\\nto mark the exceptional character of the proceeding, and to remind the\\r\\npublic that he acted under parliamentary sanction. Whatever the wearer\\'s\\r\\nobject, England was satisfied that he had a notable purpose, and\\r\\npersisted in regarding the act as significant of cowardice or of\\r\\ninsolence, of anxiety to keep within the lines of parliamentary\\r\\nprivilege or of readiness to set all law at defiance. At the time and\\r\\nlong after Bradshaw\\'s death, that hat caused an abundance of discussion;\\r\\nit was a problem which men tried in vain to solve, an enigma that\\r\\npuzzled clever heads, a riddle that was interpreted as an insult, a\\r\\ncaution, a protest, a menace, a doubt. Oxford honored it with a Latin\\r\\ninscription, and a place amongst the curiosities of the university, and\\r\\nits memory is preserved to Englishmen of the present day in the familiar\\r\\nlines--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Where England\\'s monarch once uncovered sat,\\r\\n   And Bradshaw bullied in a broad-brimmed hat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJudges were by no means unanimous with regard to the adoption of wigs,\\r\\nsome of them obstinately refusing to disfigure themselves with false\\r\\ntresses, and others displaying a foppish delight in the new decoration.\\r\\nSir Matthew Hale, who died in 1676, to the last steadily refused to\\r\\ndecorate himself with artificial locks. The likeness of the Chief\\r\\nJustice that forms the frontispiece to Burnet\\'s memoir of the lawyer,\\r\\nrepresents him in his judicial robes, wearing his SS collar, and having\\r\\non his head a cap--not the coif-cap, but one of the close-fitting\\r\\nskull-caps worn by judges in the seventeenth century. Such skull-caps,\\r\\nit has been observed in a prior page of this work, were worn by\\r\\nbarristers under their wigs, and country gentlemen at home, during the\\r\\nlast century. Into such caps readers have seen Sir Francis North put his\\r\\nfees. The portrait of Sir Cresswell Levinz (who returned to the bar on\\r\\ndismissal from the bench in 1686) shows that he wore a full-bottomed wig\\r\\nwhilst he was a judge; whereas Sir Thomas Street, who remained a judge\\r\\ntill the close of James II.\\'s reign, wore his own hair and a coif-cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Shaftesbury sat in court as Lord High Chancellor of England he wore\\r\\na hat, which Roger North is charitable enough to think might have been a\\r\\nblack hat. \"His lordship,\" says the \\'Examen,\\' \"regarded censure so\\r\\nlittle, that he did not concern himself to use a decent habit as became\\r\\na judge of his station; for he sat upon the bench in an ash-colored gown\\r\\nsilver-laced, and full-ribboned pantaloons displayed, without any black\\r\\nat all in his garb, unless it were his hat, which, now, I cannot\\r\\npositively say, though I saw him, was so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven so late as Queen Anne\\'s reign, which witnessed the introduction of\\r\\nthree-cornered hats, a Lord Keeper wore his own hair in court instead\\r\\nof a wig, until he received the sovereign\\'s order to adopt the venerable\\r\\ndisguise of a full-bottomed wig. Lady Sarah Cowper recorded of her\\r\\nfather, 1705:--\"The queen after this was persuaded to trust a Whigg\\r\\nministry, and in the year 1705, Octr., she made my father Ld. Keeper of\\r\\nthe Great Seal, in the 41st year of his age--\\'tis said the youngest Lord\\r\\nKeeper that ever had been. He looked very young, and wearing his own\\r\\nhair made him appear yet more so, which the queen observing, obliged him\\r\\nto cut it off, telling him the world would say she had given the seals\\r\\nto a boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young Lord Keeper of course obeyed; and when he appeared for the\\r\\nfirst time at court in a wig, his aspect was so grave and reverend that\\r\\nthe queen had to look at him twice before she recognized him. More than\\r\\nhalf a century later, George II. experienced a similar difficulty, when\\r\\nLord Hardwicke, after the close of his long period of official service,\\r\\nshowed himself at court in a plain suit of black velvet, with a bag and\\r\\nsword. Familiar with the appearance of the Chancellor dressed in\\r\\nfull-bottomed wig and robes, the king failed to detect his old friend\\r\\nand servant in the elderly gentleman who, in the garb of a private\\r\\nperson of quality, advanced and rendered due obeisance. \"Sir, it is Lord\\r\\nHardwicke,\" whispered a lord in waiting who stood near His Majesty\\'s\\r\\nperson, and saw the cause of the cold reception given to the\\r\\nex-Chancellor. But unfortunately the king was not more familiar with the\\r\\nex-Chancellor\\'s title than his appearance, and in a disastrous endeavor\\r\\nto be affable inquired, with an affectation of interest, \"How long has\\r\\nyour lordship been in town?\" The peer\\'s surprise and chagrin were great\\r\\nuntil the monarch, having received further instruction from the courtly\\r\\nprompter at his elbow, frankly apologized in bad English and with noisy\\r\\nlaughter. \"Had Lord Hardwicke,\" says Campbell, \"worn such a uniform as\\r\\nthat invented by George IV. for ex-Chancellors (very much like a Field\\r\\nMarshal\\'s), he could not have been mistaken for a common man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judges who at the first introduction of wigs refused to adopt them\\r\\nwere prone to express their dissatisfaction with those coxcombical\\r\\ncontrivances when exhibited upon the heads of counsel; and for some\\r\\nyears prudent juniors, anxious to win the favorable opinion of anti-wig\\r\\njustices, declined to obey the growing fashion. Chief Justice Hale, a\\r\\nnotable sloven, conspicuous amongst common law judges for the meanness\\r\\nof his attire, just as Shaftesbury was conspicuous in the Court of\\r\\nChancery for foppishness, cherished lively animosity for two sorts of\\r\\nlegal practitioners--attorneys who wore swords, and young Templars who\\r\\nadorned themselves with periwigs. Bishop Burnet says of Hale: \"He was a\\r\\ngreat encourager of all young persons that he saw followed their books\\r\\ndiligently, to whom he used to give directions concerning the method of\\r\\ntheir study, with a humanity and sweetness that wrought much on all that\\r\\ncame near him; and in a smiling, pleasant way he would admonish them, if\\r\\nhe saw anything amiss in them; particularly if they went too fine in\\r\\ntheir clothes, he would tell them it did not become their profession. He\\r\\nwas not pleased to see students wear long periwigs, or attorneys go with\\r\\nswords, so that such men as would not be persuaded to part with those\\r\\nvanities, when they went to him laid them aside and went as plain as\\r\\nthey could, to avoid the reproof which they knew they might otherwise\\r\\nexpect.\" In England, however, barristers almost universally wore wigs at\\r\\nthe close of the seventeenth century; but north of the Tweed advocates\\r\\nwore cocked hats and powdered hair so late as the middle of the\\r\\neighteenth century. When Alexander Wedderburn joined the Scotch bar in\\r\\n1754, wigs had not come into vogue with the members of his profession.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany are the good stories told of judicial wigs, and amongst the best of\\r\\nthem, is the anecdote which that malicious talker Samuel Rogers\\r\\ndelighted to tell at Edward Law\\'s expense. \"Lord Ellenborough,\" says the\\r\\n\\'Table-Talk,\\' \"was once about to go on circuit, when Lady Ellenborough\\r\\nsaid that she should like to accompany him. He replied that he had no\\r\\nobjection provided she did not encumber the carriage with bandboxes,\\r\\nwhich were his utter abhorrence. During the first day\\'s journey Lord\\r\\nEllenborough, happening to stretch his legs, struck his foot against\\r\\nsomething below the seat; he discovered that it was a bandbox. Up went\\r\\nthe window, and out went the bandbox. The coachman stopped, and the\\r\\nfootman, thinking that the bandbox had tumbled out of the window by some\\r\\nextraordinary chance, was going to pick it up, when Lord Ellenborough\\r\\nfuriously called out, \\'Drive on!\\' The bandbox, accordingly, was left by\\r\\nthe ditch-side. Having reached the county town where he was to officiate\\r\\nas judge, Lord Ellenborough proceeded to array himself for his\\r\\nappearance in the court-house. \\'Now,\\' said he, \\'where\\'s my wig?--where\\r\\n_is_ my wig?\\' \\'My lord,\\' replied his attendant, \\'it was thrown out of\\r\\nthe carriage window!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging together with fashion, barristers ceased to wear their wigs in\\r\\nsociety as soon as the gallants and bucks of the West End began to\\r\\nappear with their natural tresses in theatres and ball rooms; but the\\r\\nconservative genius of the law has hitherto triumphed over the attempts\\r\\nof eminent advocates to throw the wig out of Westminster Hall. When Lord\\r\\nCampbell argued the great Privilege case, he obtained permission to\\r\\nappear without a wig; but this concession to a counsel--who, on that\\r\\noccasion, spoke for sixteen hours--was accompanied with an intimation\\r\\nthat \"it was not to be drawn into precedent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLess wise or less fortunate than the bar, the judges of England wore\\r\\ntheir wigs in society after advocates of all ranks and degrees had\\r\\nagreed to lay aside the professional head-gear during hours of\\r\\nrelaxation. Lady Eldon\\'s good taste and care for her husband\\'s comfort,\\r\\ninduced Lord Eldon, soon after his elevation to the pillow of the Common\\r\\nPleas, to beg the king\\'s permission that he might put off his judicial\\r\\nwig on leaving the courts, in which as Chief Justice he would be\\r\\nrequired to preside. The petition did not meet with a favorable\\r\\nreception. For a minute George III. hesitated; whereupon Eldon supported\\r\\nhis prayer by observing, with the fervor of an old-fashioned Tory, that\\r\\nthe lawyer\\'s wig was a detestable innovation--unknown in the days of\\r\\nJames I. and Charles the Martyr, the judges of which two monarchs would\\r\\nhave rejected as an insult any proposal that they should assume a\\r\\nhead-dress fit only for madmen at masquerades or mummers at country\\r\\nwakes. \"What! what!\" cried the king, sharply; and then, smiling\\r\\nmischievously, as he suddenly saw a good answer to the plausible\\r\\nargument, he added--\"True, my lord, Charles the First\\'s judges wore no\\r\\nwigs, but they wore beards. You may do the same, if you like. You may\\r\\nplease yourself about wearing or not wearing your wig; but mind, if you\\r\\nplease yourself by imitating the old judges, as to the head--you must\\r\\nplease me by imitating them as to the chin. You may lay aside your wig;\\r\\nbut if you do--you must wear a beard.\" Had he lived in these days, when\\r\\nbarristers occasionally wear beards in court, and judges are not less\\r\\nconspicuous than the junior bar for magnitude of nose and whisker, Eldon\\r\\nwould have accepted the condition. But the last year of the last\\r\\ncentury, was the very centre and core of that time which may be called\\r\\nthe period of close shavers; and John Scott, the decorous and\\r\\nrespectable, would have endured martyrdom rather than have grown a\\r\\nbeard, or have allowed his whiskers to exceed the limits of mutton-chop\\r\\nwhiskers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and subsequently as Chancellor,\\r\\nEldon wore his wig whenever he appeared in general society; but in the\\r\\nprivacy of his own house he gratified Lady Eldon by laying aside the\\r\\nofficial head-gear. That this was his usage, the gossips of the\\r\\nlaw-courts knew well; and at Carlton House, when the Prince of Wales was\\r\\nmost indignant with the Chancellor, who subsequently became his familiar\\r\\nfriend, courtiers were wont to soothe the royal rage with diverting\\r\\nanecdotes of the attention which the odious lawyer lavished on the\\r\\nnatural hair that gave his Bessie so much delight. On one occasion, when\\r\\nEldon was firmly supporting the cause of the Princess of Wales, \\'the\\r\\nfirst gentleman of Europe\\' forgot common decency so far, that he made a\\r\\njeering allusion to this instance of the Chancellor\\'s domestic\\r\\namiability. \"I am not the sort of person,\" growled the prince with an\\r\\noutbreak of peevishness, \"to let my hair grow under my wig to please my\\r\\nwife.\" With becoming dignity Eldon answered--\"Your Royal Highness\\r\\ncondescends to be personal. I beg leave to withdraw;\" and suiting his\\r\\naction to his words, the Chancellor made a low bow to the angry prince,\\r\\nand retired. The prince sneaked out of the position by an untruth,\\r\\ninstead of an apology. On the following day he caused a written\\r\\nassurance to be conveyed to the Chancellor, that the offensive speech\\r\\n\"was nothing personal, but simply a proverb--a proverbial way of saying\\r\\na man was governed by his wife.\" It is needless to say that the\\r\\nexpression was not proverbial, but distinctly and grossly personal. Lord\\r\\nMalmesbury\\'s comment on this affair is \"Very absurd of Lord Eldon; but\\r\\nexplained by his having literally done what the prince said.\" Lord\\r\\nEldon\\'s conduct absurd! What was the prince\\'s?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANDS AND COLLARS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBands came into fashion with Englishmen many years before wigs, but like\\r\\nwigs they were worn in general society before they became a recognized\\r\\nand distinctive feature of professional costume. Ladies of rank dyed\\r\\ntheir hair, and wore false tresses in Elizabethan England; but their\\r\\nexample was not extensively followed by the men of their time--although\\r\\nthe courtiers of the period sometimes donned \\'periwinkes,\\' to the\\r\\nextreme disgust of the multitude, and the less stormy disapprobation of\\r\\nthe polite. The frequency with which bands are mentioned in Elizabethan\\r\\nliterature, affords conclusive evidence that they were much worn toward\\r\\nthe close of the sixteenth century; and it is also matter of certainty\\r\\nthat they were known in England at a still earlier period. Henry VIII.\\r\\nhad \"4 shirte bands of silver with ruffes to the same, whereof one was\\r\\nperled with golde;\" and in 1638 Peacham observed, \"King Henry VIII. was\\r\\nthe first that ever wore a band about his neck, and that very plain,\\r\\nwithout lace, and about an inch or two in depth. We may see how the case\\r\\nis altered, he is not a gentleman, or in the fashion, whose band of\\r\\nItalian cutwork standeth him not at the least in three or four pounds;\\r\\nyea, a sempster in Holborn told me there are of threescore pound price\\r\\napiece.\" That the fops of Charles I.\\'s reign were spending money on a\\r\\nfashion originally set by King Henry the Bluff, was the opinion also of\\r\\nTaylor the Water Poet, who in 1630 wrote--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Now up alofte I mount unto the ruffe,\\r\\n   Which into foolish mortals pride doth puffe;\\r\\n   Yet ruffes\\' antiquity is here but small--\\r\\n   Within this eighty years not one at all;\\r\\n   For the Eighth Henry (so I understand)\\r\\n   Was the first king that ever wore a _band_;\\r\\n   And but a _falling-band_, plaine with a hem;\\r\\n   All other people knew no use of them.\\r\\n   Yet imitation in small time began\\r\\n   To grow, that it the kingdom overran;\\r\\n   The little falling-bands encreased to ruffes,\\r\\n   Ruffes (growing great) were waited on by cuffes,\\r\\n   And though our frailties should awake our care,\\r\\n   We make our ruffes as careless as we are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regarding the falling-band as the germ of the ruff, the Water-Poet\\r\\ndiffers from those writers who, with greater appearance of reason,\\r\\nmaintain that the ruff was the parent of the band. Into this question\\r\\nconcerning origin of species, there is no occasion to enter on the\\r\\npresent occasion. It is enough to state that in the earlier part of the\\r\\nseventeenth century bands or collars--bands stiffened and standing at\\r\\nthe backward part, and bands falling upon the shoulder and breast--were\\r\\narticles of costume upon which men of expensive and modish habits spent\\r\\nlarge sums.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days of James I., when standing bands were still the fashion, and\\r\\nfalling-bands had not come in, the Inns of Court men were very\\r\\nparticular about the stiffness, cut, and texture of their collars.\\r\\nSpeaking of the Inns of Court men, Sir Thomas Overbury, (who was\\r\\npoisoned in 1613), says: \"He laughs at every man whose band sits not\\r\\nwell, or that hath not a fair shoe-type, and is ashamed to be in any\\r\\nman\\'s company who wears not his cloathes well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf portraits may be trusted, the falling-band of Charles I.\\'s time, bore\\r\\nconsiderable resemblance to the falling neck-frill, which twenty years\\r\\nsince was very generally worn by quite little boys, and is still sometimes\\r\\nseen on urchins who are about six years of age. The bands worn by the\\r\\nbarristers and clergy of our own time are modifications of this antique\\r\\nfalling-band, and like the coif cap of the modern sergeant, they bear\\r\\nonly a faint likeness to their originals. But though bands--longer than\\r\\nthose still worn by clergymen--have come to be a distinctive feature of\\r\\nlegal costume, the bar was slow to adopt falling-collars--regarding them\\r\\nas a strange and fanciful innovation. Whitelock\\'s personal narrative\\r\\nfurnishes pleasant testimony that the younger gentry of Charles I.\\'s\\r\\nEngland adopted the new collar before the working lawyers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the Quarter-Sessions of Oxford,\" says Whitelock, speaking of the\\r\\nyear 1635, when he was only thirty years of age, \"I was put into the\\r\\nchair in court, though I was in colored clothes, a sword by my side, and\\r\\na falling-band, which was unusual for lawyers in those days, and in this\\r\\ngarb I gave the charge to the Grand Jury. I took occasion to enlarge on\\r\\nthe point of jurisdiction in the temporal courts in matters\\r\\necclesiastical, and the antiquity thereof, which I did the rather\\r\\nbecause the spiritual men began in those days to swell higher than\\r\\nordinary, and to take it as an injury to the Church that anything\\r\\nsavoring of the spirituality, should be within the cognisance of\\r\\nignorant laymen. The gentlemen and freeholders seemed well pleased with\\r\\nmy charge, and the management of the business of the sessions; and said\\r\\nthey perceived one might speak as good sense in a falling-band as in a\\r\\nruff.\" At this time Whitelock had been about seven years at the bar; but\\r\\nat the Quarter-Sessions the young Templar was playing the part of\\r\\ncountry squire, and as his words show, he was dressed in a fashion that\\r\\ndirectly violated professional usage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhitelock\\'s speech seems to have been made shortly before the bar\\r\\naccepted the falling-band as an article of dress admissible in courts of\\r\\nlaw. Towards the close of Charles\\'s reign, such bands were very\\r\\ngenerally worn in Westminster Hall by the gentlemen of the long robe;\\r\\nand after the Restoration, a barrister would as soon have thought of\\r\\nappearing at the King\\'s Bench without his gown as without his band.\\r\\nUnlike the bar-bands of the present time--which are lappets of fine\\r\\nlawn, of simple make--the bands worn by Charles II.\\'s lawyers were\\r\\ndainty and expensive articles, such as those which Peacham exclaimed\\r\\nagainst in the preceding reign. At that date the Templar in prosperous\\r\\ncircumstances had his bands made entirely of point lace, or of fine lawn\\r\\nedged with point lace; and as he wore them in society as well as in\\r\\ncourt, he was constantly requiring a fresh supply of them. Few accidents\\r\\nwere more likely to ruffle a Templar\\'s equanimity than a mishap to his\\r\\nband occurring through his own inadvertence or carelessness on the part\\r\\nof a servant. At table the pieces of delicate lace-work were exposed to\\r\\nmany dangers. Continually were they stained with wine or soiled with\\r\\ngravy, and the young lawyer was deemed a marvel of amiability who could\\r\\nsee his point lace thus defiled and abstain from swearing. \"I remember,\"\\r\\nobserves Roger North, when he is showing the perfect control in which\\r\\nhis brother Francis kept his temper, at his table a stupid servant spilt\\r\\na glass of red wine upon his point band and clothes. \"He only wiped his\\r\\nface and clothes with the napkin, and \\'Here,\\' said he, \\'take this away;\\'\\r\\nand no more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \\'The London Spy,\\' Ned Ward shows that during Queen Anne\\'s reign legal\\r\\npractitioners of the lowest sort were particular to wear bands.\\r\\nDescribing the pettifogger, Ward says, \"He always talks with as great\\r\\nassurance as if he understood what he pretends to know; and always wears\\r\\na band, in which lies his gravity and wisdom.\" At the same period a\\r\\nbrisk trade was carried on in Westminster Hall by the sempstresses who\\r\\nmanufactured bands and cuffs, lace ruffles, and lawn kerchiefs for the\\r\\ngrave counsellors and young gallants of the Inns of Court. \"From\\r\\nthence,\" says the author of \\'The London Spy\\', \"we walked down by the\\r\\nsempstresses, who were very nicely digitising and pleating turnsovers\\r\\nand ruffles for the young students, and coaxing them with amorous looks,\\r\\nobliging cant, and inviting gestures, to give so extravagant a price for\\r\\nwhat they buy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom collars of lace and lawn, let us turn to collars of precious metal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAntiquarians have unanimously rejected the fanciful legend adopted by\\r\\nDugdale concerning the SS collar, as well as many not less ingenious\\r\\ninterpretations of the mystic letters; and at the present time it is\\r\\nalmost unanimously settled that the SS collar is the old Lancastrian\\r\\nbadge, corresponding to the Yorkist collar of Roses and Suns, and that\\r\\nthe S is either the initial of the sentimental word \\'Souvenez,\\' or, as\\r\\nMr. Beltz maintains, the initial letter of the sentimental motto,\\r\\n\\'Souvenez-vous de moi.\\' In Mr. Foss\\'s valuable work, \\'The Judges of\\r\\nEngland,\\' at the commencement of the seventh volume, the curious reader\\r\\nmay find an excellent summary of all that has been or can be said about\\r\\nthe origin of this piece of feudal livery, which, having at one time\\r\\nbeen very generally assumed by all gentle and fairly prosperous\\r\\npartisans of the House of Lancaster, has for many generations been the\\r\\ndistinctive badge of a few official persons. In the second year of Henry\\r\\nIV. an ordinance forbade knights and Esquires to wear the collar, save\\r\\nin the king\\'s presence; and in the reign of Henry VIII., the privilege\\r\\nof wearing the collar was taken away from simple esquires by the \\'Acte\\r\\nfor Reformacyon of Excesse in Apparayle,\\' 24 Henry VIII. c. 13, which\\r\\nordained \"That no man oneless he be a knight ... weare any color of\\r\\nGold, named a color of S.\" Gradually knights and non-official persons\\r\\nrelinquished the decoration; and in our own day the right to bear it is\\r\\nrestricted to the two Chief Justices, the Chief Baron, the\\r\\nsergeant-trumpetor, and all the officers of the Heralds\\' College,\\r\\npursuivants excepted; \"unless,\" adds Mr. Foss, \"the Lord Mayor of London\\r\\nis to be included, whose collar is somewhat similar, and is composed of\\r\\ntwenty-eight SS, fourteen roses, thirteen knots; and measures sixty-four\\r\\ninches.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nBAGS AND GOWNS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the stages of the Caroline theatres the lawyer is found with a green\\r\\nbag in his hand; the same is the case in the literature of Queen Anne\\'s\\r\\nreign; and until a comparatively recent date green bags were generally\\r\\ncarried in Westminster Hall and in provincial courts by the great body\\r\\nof legal practitioners. From Wycherley\\'s \\'Plain Dealer,\\' it appears that\\r\\nin the time of Charles II. angry clients were accustomed to revile their\\r\\nlawyers as \\'green bag-carriers.\\' When the litigious Widow Blackacre\\r\\nupbraids the barrister who declines to argue for her, she\\r\\nexclaims--\"Impertinent again, and ignorant to me! Gadsboddikins! you\\r\\npuny upstart in the law, to use me so, you green-bag carrier, you\\r\\nmurderer of unfortunate causes, the clerk\\'s ink is scarce off of your\\r\\nfingers.\" In the same drama, making much play with the green bag,\\r\\nWycherley indicates the Widow Blackacre\\'s quarrelsome disposition by\\r\\ndecorating her with an enormous green reticule, and makes her son the\\r\\nlaw-student, stagger about the stage in a gown, and under a heavy burden\\r\\nof green bags.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo also in the time of Queen Anne, to say that a man intended to carry a\\r\\ngreen bag, was the same as saying that he meant to adopt the law as a\\r\\nprofession. In Dr. Arbuthnot\\'s \\'History of John Bull,\\' the prevalence of\\r\\nthe phrase is shown by the passage, \"I am told, Cousin Diego, you are\\r\\none of those that have undertaken to manage me, and that you have said\\r\\nyou will carry a green bag yourself, rather than we shall make an end of\\r\\nour lawsuit. I\\'ll teach them and you too to manage.\" It must, however,\\r\\nbe borne in mind that in Queen Anne\\'s time, green bags, like white\\r\\nbands, were as generally adopted by solicitors and attorneys, as by\\r\\nmembers of the bar. In his \\'character of a pettifogger\\' the author of\\r\\n\\'The London Spy\\' observes--\"His learning is commonly as little as his\\r\\nhonesty, and his conscience much larger than his green bag.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years have elapsed since green bags altogether disappeared from our\\r\\ncourts of law; but the exact date of their disappearance has hitherto\\r\\nescaped the vigilance and research of Colonel Landman, \\'Causidicus,\\' and\\r\\nother writers who in the pages of that useful and very entertaining\\r\\npublication, _Notes and Queries_, have asked for information on that\\r\\npoint and kindred questions. Evidence sets aside the suggestion that the\\r\\ncolor of the lawyer\\'s bag was changed from green to red because the\\r\\nproceedings at Queen Caroline\\'s trial rendered green bags odious to the\\r\\npublic, and even dangerous to their bearers; for it is a matter of\\r\\ncertainty that the leaders of the Chancery and Common Law bars carried\\r\\nred bags at a time considerably anterior to the inquiry into the queen\\'s\\r\\nconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a letter addressed to the editor of _Notes and Queries_, a writer who\\r\\nsigns himself \\'Causidicus,\\' observes--\"When I entered the profession\\r\\n(about fifty years ago) no junior barrister presumed to carry a bag in\\r\\nthe Court of Chancery, unless one had been presented to him by a King\\'s\\r\\nCounsel; who, when a junior was advancing in practice, took an\\r\\nopportunity of complimenting him on his increase of business, and giving\\r\\nhim his own bag to carry home his papers. It was then a distinction to\\r\\ncarry a bag, and a proof that a junior was rising in his profession. I\\r\\ndo not know whether the custom prevailed in other courts.\" From this it\\r\\nappears that fifty years since the bag was an honorable distinction at\\r\\nthe Chancery bar, giving its bearer some such professional status as\\r\\nthat which is conferred by \\'silk\\' in these days when Queen\\'s Counsel are\\r\\nnumerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same professional usage seems to have prevailed at the Common Law\\r\\nbar more than eighty years ago; for in 1780, when Edward Law joined the\\r\\nNorthern Circuit, and forthwith received a large number of briefs, he\\r\\nwas complimented by Wallace on his success, and presented with a bag.\\r\\nLord Campbell asserts that no case had ever before occurred where a\\r\\njunior won the distinction of a bag during the course of his first\\r\\ncircuit. There is no record of the date when members of the junior bar\\r\\nreceived permission to carry bags according to their own pleasure; it is\\r\\neven matter of doubt whether the permission was ever expressly accorded\\r\\nby the leaders of the profession--or whether the old restrictive usage\\r\\ndied a gradual and unnoticed death. The present writer, however, is\\r\\nassured that at the Chancery bar, long after _all_ juniors were allowed\\r\\nto carry bags, etiquette forbade them to adopt bags of the same color as\\r\\nthose carried by their leaders. An eminent Queen\\'s Counsel, who is a\\r\\nmember of that bar, remembers that when he first donned a stuff gown,\\r\\nhe, like all Chancery jurors, had a purple bag--whereas the wearers of\\r\\nsilk at the same period, without exception, carried red bags.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore a complete and satisfactory account can be given of the use of\\r\\nbags by lawyers, as badges of honor and marks of distinction, answers\\r\\nmust be found for several questions which at present remain open to\\r\\ndiscussion. So late as Queen Anne\\'s reign, lawyers of the lowest\\r\\nstanding, whether advocates or attorneys, were permitted to carry\\r\\nbags;--a right which the junior bar appears to have lost when Edward Law\\r\\njoined the Northern Circuit. At what date between Queen Anne\\'s day and\\r\\n1780 (the year in which Lord Ellenborough made his _début_ in the\\r\\nNorth), was this change effected? Was the change gradual or sudden? To\\r\\nwhat cause was it due? Again, is it possible that Lord Campbell and\\r\\nCausidicus wrote under a misapprehension, when they gave testimony\\r\\nconcerning the usages of the bar with regard to bags, at the close of\\r\\nthe last and the beginning of the present century? The memory of the\\r\\ndistinguished Queen\\'s Counsel, to whom allusion is made in the preceding\\r\\nparagraph, is quite clear that in his student days Chancery jurors were\\r\\nforbidden by etiquette to carry _red_ bags, but were permitted to carry\\r\\nblue bags; and he is strongly of opinion that the restriction, to which\\r\\nLord Campbell and Causidicus draw attention, did not apply at any time\\r\\nto blue bags, but only concerned red bags, which, so late as thirty\\r\\nyears since, unquestionably were the distinguishing marks of men in\\r\\nleading Chancery practice. Perhaps legal readers of this chapter will\\r\\nfavor the writer with further information on this not highly important,\\r\\nbut still not altogether uninteresting subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liberality which for the last five and-twenty years has marked the\\r\\ndistribution of \\'silk\\' to rising members of the bar, and the ease with\\r\\nwhich all fairly successful advocates may obtain the rank of Queen\\'s\\r\\nCounsel, enable lawyers of the present generation to smile at a rule\\r\\nwhich defined a man\\'s professional position by the color of his bag,\\r\\ninstead of the texture of his gown; but in times when \\'silk\\' was given\\r\\nto comparatively few members of the bar, and when that distinction was\\r\\nmost unfairly withheld from the brightest ornaments of their profession,\\r\\nif their political opinions displeased the \\'party in power,\\' it was\\r\\nnatural and reasonable in the bar to institute for themselves an \\'order\\r\\nof merit\\'--to which deserving candidates could obtain admission without\\r\\nreference to the prejudices of a Chancellor or the whims of a clique.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present the sovereign\\'s counsel learned in the law constitute a\\r\\ndistinct order of the profession; but until the reign of William IV.\\r\\nthey were merely a handful of court favorites. In most cases they were\\r\\nsound lawyers in full employment; but the immediate cause of their\\r\\nelevation was almost always some political consideration--and sometimes\\r\\nthe lucky wearer of a silk gown had won the right to put K.C. or Q.C.\\r\\nafter his name by base compliance with ministerial power. That our\\r\\nearlier King\\'s Counsel were not created from the purest motives or for\\r\\nthe most honorable purposes will be readily admitted by the reader who\\r\\nreflects that \\'silk gowns\\' are a legal species, for which the nation is\\r\\nindebted to the Stuarts. For all practical purposes Francis Bacon was a\\r\\nQ.C. during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. He enjoyed peculiar and\\r\\ndistinctive _status_ as a barrister, being consulted on legal matters by\\r\\nthe Queen, although he held no place that in familiar parlance would\\r\\nentitle him to rank with her Crown Lawyers; and his biographers have\\r\\nagreed to call him Elizabeth\\'s counsellor learned in the law. But a Q.C.\\r\\nholding his office by patent--that is to say, a Q.C. as that term is\\r\\nunderstood at the present time--Francis Bacon never was. On the\\r\\naccession, however, of James I., he received his formal appointment of\\r\\nK.C., the new monarch having seen fit to recognise the lawyer\\'s claim to\\r\\nbe regarded as a \\'special counsel,\\' or \\'learned counsel extraordinary.\\'\\r\\nAnother barrister of the same period who obtained the same distinction\\r\\nwas Sir Henry Montague, who, in a patent granted in 1608 to the two\\r\\nTemples, is styled \"one of our counsel learned in the law.\" Thus\\r\\nplanted, the institution of monarch\\'s special counsel was for many\\r\\ngenerations a tree of slow growth. Until George III.\\'s reign the number\\r\\nof monarch\\'s counsel, living and practising at the same time, was never\\r\\nlarge; and throughout the long period of that king\\'s rule the fraternity\\r\\nof K.C. never assumed them agnitude and character of a professional\\r\\norder. It is uncertain what was the greatest number of contemporaneous\\r\\nK.C.\\'s during the Stuart dynasty; but there is no doubt that from the\\r\\narrival of James I. to the flight of James II. there was no period when\\r\\nthe K.C.\\'s at all approached the sergeants in name and influence. In\\r\\nRymer\\'s \\'Foedera\\' mention is made of four barristers who were appointed\\r\\ncounsellors to Charles I., one of whom, Sir John Finch, in a patent of\\r\\nprecedence is designated \"King\\'s Counsel;\" but it is not improbable that\\r\\nthe royal martyr had other special counsellors whose names have not been\\r\\nrecorded. At different times of Charles II.\\'s reign, there were created\\r\\nsome seventeen K.C.\\'s, and seven times that number of sergeants. James\\r\\nII. made ten K.C.\\'s; William and Mary appointed eleven special\\r\\ncounsellors; and the number of Q.C.\\'s appointed by Anne was ten. The\\r\\nnames of George I.\\'s learned counsel are not recorded; the list of\\r\\nGeorge II.\\'s K.C.\\'s, together with barristers holding patents of\\r\\nprecedence, comprise thirty names; George III. throughout his long\\r\\ntenure of the crown, gave \\'silk\\' with or without the title of K.C., to\\r\\nninety-three barristers; George IV. to twenty-six; whereas the list of\\r\\nWilliam IV.\\'s appointments comprised sixty-five names, and the present\\r\\nqueen has conferred the rank of Q.C. on about two hundred advocates--the\\r\\nlaw-list for 1865 mentioning one hundred and thirty-seven barristers who\\r\\nare Q.C.\\'s, or holders of patents of precedence; and only twenty-eight\\r\\nsergeants-at-law, not sitting as judges in any of the supreme courts.\\r\\nThe diminution in the numbers of the sergeants is due partly to the loss\\r\\nof their old monopoly of business in the Common Pleas, and partly--some\\r\\nsay chiefly--to the profuseness with which silk gowns, with Q.C. rank\\r\\nattached, have been thrown to the bar since the passing of the Reform\\r\\nBill.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the old system when \\'silk\\' was less bountifully bestowed, eminent\\r\\nbarristers not only led their circuits in stuff; but, after holding\\r\\noffice as legal advisers to the crown and wearing silk gowns whilst they\\r\\nso acted with their political friends, they sometimes resumed their\\r\\nstuff gowns and places \\'outside the bar,\\' on descending from official\\r\\neminence. When Charles York in 1763 resigned the post of Attorney\\r\\nGeneral, he returned to his old place in court without the bar, clad in\\r\\nthe black bombazine of an ordinary barrister, whereas during his tenure\\r\\nof office he had worn silk and sat within the bar. In the same manner\\r\\nwhen Dunning resigned the Solicitor Generalship in 1770, he reappeared\\r\\nin the Court of King\\'s Bench, attired in stuff, and took his place\\r\\nwithout the bar; but as soon as he had made his first motion, he was\\r\\naddressed by Lord Mansfield, who with characteristic courtesy informed\\r\\nhim that he should take precedence in that court before all members of\\r\\nthe bar, whatever might be their standing, with the exception of King\\'s\\r\\nCounsel, Sergeants, and the Recorder of London. On joining the Northern\\r\\nCircuit in 1780, Edward Law found Wallace and Lee leading in silk, and\\r\\ntwenty years later he and Jemmy Park were the K.C.\\'s of the same\\r\\ndistrict; Of course the circuit was not without wearers of the coif, one\\r\\nof its learned sergeants being Cockell, who, before Law obtained the\\r\\nleading place, was known as \\'the Almighty of the North;\\' and whose\\r\\nsuccess, achieved in spite of an almost total ignorance of legal\\r\\nscience, was long quoted to show that though knowledge is power, power\\r\\nmay be won without knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom pure dislike of the thought that younger men should follow closely\\r\\nor at a distance in his steps to the highest eminences of legal success,\\r\\nLord Eldon was disgracefully stingy in bestowing honors on rising\\r\\nbarristers who belonged to his own party, but his injustice and\\r\\ndownright oppression to brilliant advocates in the Whig ranks merit the\\r\\nwarmest expressions of disapproval and contempt. The most notorious\\r\\nsufferers from his rancorous intolerance were Henry Brougham and Mr.\\r\\nDenman, who, having worn silk gowns as Queen Caroline\\'s Attorney General\\r\\nand Solicitor General, were reduced to stuff attire on that wretched\\r\\nlady\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worthy of notice that in old time, when silk gowns were few, their\\r\\nwearers were sometimes very young men. From the days of Francis North,\\r\\nwho was made K.C. before he was a barrister for seven full years\\'\\r\\nstanding, down to the days of Eldon, who obtained silk after seven\\r\\nyears\\' service in stuff, instances could be cited of the rapidity with\\r\\nwhich lucky youngsters rose to the honors of silk, whilst hard-worked\\r\\nveterans were to the last kept outside the bar. Thurlow was called to\\r\\nthe bar in November, 1754, and donned silk in December, 1761. Six years\\r\\nhad now elapsed since his call to the English bar, when Alexander\\r\\nWedderburn was entitled to put the initials K.C. after his name, and\\r\\nwrote to his mother in Scotland, \"I can\\'t very well explain to you the\\r\\nnature of my preferment, but it is what most people at the bar are very\\r\\ndesirous of, and yet most people run a hazard of losing money by it. I\\r\\ncan scarcely expect any advantage from it for some time equal to what I\\r\\ngive up; and, notwithstanding, I am extremely happy, and esteem myself\\r\\nvery fortunate in having obtained it.\" Erskine\\'s silk was won with even\\r\\ngreater speed, for he was invited within the bar, but his silk gown\\r\\ncame to him with a patent of precedence, giving him the status without\\r\\nthe title of a King\\'s Counsel.\\r\\n\\r\\nBar mourning is no longer a feature of legal costume in England. On the\\r\\ndeath of Charles II. members of the bar donned gowns indicative of their\\r\\ngrief for the national loss, and they continued, either universally or\\r\\nin a large number of cases, to wear these woful habiliments till 1697,\\r\\nwhen Chief Justice Holt ordered all barristers practising in his court\\r\\nto appear \"in their proper gowns and not in mourning ones\"--an order\\r\\nwhich, according to Narcissus Luttrell, compelled the bar to spend £15\\r\\nper man. From this it may be inferred that (regard being had to change\\r\\nin value of money) a bar-gown at the close of the seventeenth century\\r\\ncost about ten times as much as it does at the present time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nHATS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot less famous in history than Bradshaw\\'s broad-brimmed hat, nor less\\r\\ngraceful than Shaftesbury\\'s jaunty beaver, nor less memorable than the\\r\\nsailor\\'s tarpaulin, under cover of which Jeffreys slunk into the Red\\r\\nCow, Wapping, nor less striking than the black cap still worn by Justice\\r\\nin her sternest mood, nor less fanciful than the cocked hat which\\r\\ncovered Wedderburn\\'s powdered hair when he daily paced the High Street\\r\\nof Edinburgh with his hands in a muff--was the white hat which an\\r\\nillustrious Templar invented at an early date of the eighteenth century.\\r\\nBeau Brummel\\'s original mind taught the human species to starch their\\r\\nwhite cravats; Richard Nash, having surmounted the invidious bar of\\r\\nplebeian birth and raised himself upon opposing circumstances to the\\r\\nthrone of Bath, produced a white hat. To which of these great men\\r\\nsociety owes the heavier debt of gratitude thoughtful historians cannot\\r\\nagree; but even envious detraction admits that they deserve high rank\\r\\namongst the benefactors of mankind. Brummel was a soldier; but Law\\r\\nproudly claims as her own the parent of the pale and spotless _chapeau_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout lawyers\\' cocked hats a capital volume might be written, that\\r\\nshould contain no better story than the one which is told of Ned\\r\\nThurlow\\'s discomfiture in 1788, when he was playing a trickster\\'s game\\r\\nwith his friends and foes. Windsor Castle just then contained three\\r\\ndistinct centres of public interest--the mad king in the hands of his\\r\\nkeepers; on the one side of the impotent monarch the Prince of Wales\\r\\nwaiting impatiently for the Regency; on the other side, the queen with\\r\\nequal impatience longing for her husband\\'s recovery. The prince and his\\r\\nmother both had apartments in the castle, her majesty\\'s quarters being\\r\\nthe place of meeting for the Tory ministers, whilst the prince\\'s\\r\\napartments were thrown open to the select leaders of the Whig\\r\\nexpectants. Of course the two coteries kept jealously apart; but\\r\\nThurlow, who wished to be still Lord Chancellor, \"whatever king might\\r\\nreign,\" was in private communication with the prince\\'s friends. With\\r\\nfurtive steps he passed from the queen\\'s room (where he had a minute\\r\\nbefore been assuring the ministers that he would be faithful to the\\r\\nking\\'s adherents), and made clandestine way to the apartment where\\r\\nSheridan and Payne were meditating on the advantages of a regency\\r\\nwithout restriction. On leaving the prince, the wary lawyer used to\\r\\nsteal into the king\\'s chamber, and seek guidance or encouragement from\\r\\nthe madman\\'s restless eyes. Was the malady curable? If curable, how\\r\\nlong a time would elapse before the return of reason? These were the\\r\\nquestions which the Chancellor put to himself, as he debated whether he\\r\\nshould break with the Tories and go over to the Whigs. Through the\\r\\naction of the patient\\'s disease, the most delicate part of the lawyer\\'s\\r\\noccupation was gone; and having no longer a king\\'s conscience to keep,\\r\\nhe did not care, by way of diversion--to keep his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many days ere they received clear demonstration of the Chancellor\\'s\\r\\ndeceit, the other members of the cabinet suspected that he was acting\\r\\ndisingenuously, and when his double-dealing was brought to their sure\\r\\nknowledge, their indignation was not even qualified with surprise. The\\r\\nstory of his exposure is told in various ways; but all versions concur\\r\\nin attributing his detection to an accident. Like the gallant of the\\r\\nFrench court, whose clandestine intercourse with a great lady was\\r\\ndiscovered because, in his hurried preparations for flight from her\\r\\nchamber, he appropriated one of her stockings, Thurlow, according to one\\r\\naccount, was convicted of perfidy by the prince\\'s hat, which he bore\\r\\nunder his arm on entering the closet where the ministers awaited his\\r\\ncoming. Another version says that Thurlow had taken his seat at the\\r\\ncouncil-table, when his hat was brought to him by a page, with an\\r\\nexplanation that he had left it in the prince\\'s private room. A third,\\r\\nand more probable representation of the affair, instead of laying the\\r\\nscene in the council-chamber, makes the exposure occur in a more public\\r\\npart of the castle. \"When a council was to be held at Windsor,\" said the\\r\\nRight Honorable Thomas Grenville, in his old age recounting the\\r\\nparticulars of the mishap, \"to determine the course which ministers\\r\\nshould pursue, Thurlow had been there some time before any of his\\r\\ncolleagues arrived. He was to be brought back to London by one of them,\\r\\nand the moment of departure being come, the Chancellor\\'s hat was\\r\\nnowhere to be found. After a fruitless search in the apartment where the\\r\\ncouncil had been held, a page came with the hat in his hand, saying\\r\\naloud, and with great _naïveté_, \\'My lord, I found it in the closet of\\r\\nhis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.\\' The other Ministers were still\\r\\nin the Hall, and Thurlow\\'s confusion corroborated the inference which\\r\\nthey drew.\" Cannot an artist be found to place upon canvas this scene,\\r\\nwhich furnishes the student of human nature with an instructive instance\\r\\nof\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"That combination strange--a lawyer and a blush?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some days Thurlow\\'s embarrassment and chagrim were very painful. But\\r\\na change in the state of the king\\'s health caused a renewal of the\\r\\nlawyer\\'s attachment to Tory principles and to his sovereign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyers of what may be termed the cocked hat period seldom\\r\\nmaintained the happy mean between too little and too great care for\\r\\npersonal appearance. For the most part they were either slovenly or\\r\\nfoppish. From the days when as a student he used to slip into Nando\\'s in\\r\\na costume that raised the supercilious astonishment of his\\r\\ncontemporaries, Thurlow to the last erred on the side of neglect. Camden\\r\\nroused the satire of an earlier generation by the miserable condition of\\r\\nthe tiewig which he wore on the bench of Chancery, and by an undignified\\r\\nand provoking habit of \"gartering up his stockings while counsel were\\r\\nthe most strenuous in their eloquence.\" On the other hand Joseph\\r\\nYates--the puisne judge whom Mansfield\\'s jeers and merciless oppressions\\r\\ndrove from the King\\'s Bench to the Common Pleas, where he died within\\r\\nfour months of his retreat--was the finest of fine gentlemen. Before he\\r\\nhad demonstrated his professional capacity, the habitual costliness and\\r\\ndelicacy of his attire roused the distrust of attorneys, and on more\\r\\nthan one occasion wrought him injury. An awkward, crusty, hard-featured\\r\\nattorney entered the foppish barrister\\'s chambers with a bundle of\\r\\npapers, and on seeing the young man in a superb and elaborate evening\\r\\ndress, is said to have inquired, \"Can you say, sir, when Mr. Yates will\\r\\nreturn?\" \"Return, my good sir!\" answered the barrister, with an air of\\r\\nsurprise, \"I am Mr. Yates, and it will give me the greatest pleasure to\\r\\ntalk with you about those papers.\" Having taken a deliberate survey of\\r\\nthe young Templar, and made a mental inventory of all the fantastic\\r\\narticles of his apparel, the honest attorney gave an ominous grunt,\\r\\nreplaced the papers in one of the deep pockets of his long-skirted coat,\\r\\ntwice nodded his head with contemptuous significance, and then, without\\r\\nanother word--walked out of the room. It was his first visit to those\\r\\nchambers, and his last. Joseph Yates lost his client, before he could\\r\\neven learn his name; but in no way influenced by the occurrence he\\r\\nmaintained his reputation for faultless taste in dress, and when he had\\r\\nraised himself to the bench, he was amongst the judges of his day all\\r\\nthat Revell Reynolds was amongst the London physicians of a later date.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in the midst of the fierce contentions which distracted Ireland\\r\\nin the days of our grandfathers, John Toler, first Earl of Norbury,\\r\\nwould not have escaped odium and evil repute, had he been a merciful man\\r\\nand a scrupulous judge; but in consequence of failings and wicked\\r\\npropensities, which gave countenance to the slanders of his enemies and\\r\\nat the same time earned for him the distrust and aversion of his\\r\\npolitical coadjutors, he has found countless accusers and not a single\\r\\nvindicator. Resembling George Jeffreys in temper and mental capacity, he\\r\\nresembled him also in posthumous fame. A shrewd, selfish, overbearing\\r\\nman, possessing wit which was exercised with equal promptitude upon\\r\\nfriends and foes, he alternately roused the terror and the laughter of\\r\\nhis audiences. At the bar and in the Irish House of Commons he was alike\\r\\nnotorious as jester and bully; but he was a courageous bully, and to the\\r\\nlast was always as ready to fight with bullets as with epigrams, and\\r\\nthough his humor was especially suited to the taste and passions of the\\r\\nrabble, it sometimes convulsed with merriment those who were shocked by\\r\\nits coarseness and brutality. Having voted for the abolition of the\\r\\nIrish Parliament, the Right Honorable John Toler was prepared to justify\\r\\nhis conduct with hair-triggers or sarcasms. To the men who questioned\\r\\nhis patriotism he was wont to answer, \"Name any hour before my court\\r\\nopens to-morrow,\" but to the patriotic Irish lady who loudly charged him\\r\\nin a crowded drawing-room with having sold his country, he replied, with\\r\\nan affectation of cordial assent, \"Certainly, madam, I have sold my\\r\\ncountry. It was very lucky for me that I had a country to sell--I wish I\\r\\nhad another.\" On the bench he spared neither counsel nor suitors,\\r\\nneither witnesses nor jurors. When Daniel O\\'Connell, whilst he was\\r\\nconducting a cause in the Irish Court of Common Pleas, observed, \"Pardon\\r\\nme, my lord, I am afraid your lordship does not apprehend me;\" the Chief\\r\\nJustice (alluding to a scandalous and false report that O\\'Connell had\\r\\navoided a duel by surrendering himself to the police) retorted, \"Pardon\\r\\nme also; no one is more easily apprehended than Mr. O\\'Connell\"--(a\\r\\npause--and then with emphatic slowness of utterance)--\"whenever he\\r\\nwishes to be apprehended.\" It is _said_ that when this same judge passed\\r\\nsentence of death on Robert Emmett, he paused when he came to the point\\r\\nwhere it is usual for a judge to add in conclusion, \"And may the Lord\\r\\nhave mercy on your soul!\" and regarded the brave young man with\\r\\nsearching eyes. For a minute there was an awful silence in the court;\\r\\nthe bar and the assembled crowd supposing that the Chief Justice had\\r\\npaused so that a few seconds of unbroken stillness might add to the\\r\\nsolemnity of his last words. The disgust and indignation of the\\r\\nspectators were beyond the power of language, when they saw a smile of\\r\\nbrutal sarcasm steal over the face of the Chief Justice as he rose from\\r\\nhis seat of judgment without uttering another word.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the state prosecutions were going forward, Lord Norbury appeared\\r\\non the bench in a costume that accorded ill with the gravity of his\\r\\noffice. The weather was intensely hot; and whilst he was at his morning\\r\\ntoilet the Chief Justice selected from his wardrobe the dress which was\\r\\nmost suited to the sultriness of the air. The garb thus selected for its\\r\\ncoolness was a dress which his lordship had worn at a masquerade ball,\\r\\nand consisted of a green tabinet coat decorated with huge\\r\\nmother-of-pearl buttons, a waistcoat of yellow relieved by black\\r\\nstripes, and buff breeches. When he first entered the court, and\\r\\nthroughout all the earlier part of the proceedings against a party of\\r\\nrebels, his judicial robes altogether concealed this grotesque attire;\\r\\nbut unfortunately towards the close of the sultry day\\'s work, Lord\\r\\nNorbury--oppressed by the stifling atmosphere of the court, and\\r\\nforgetting all about the levity as well as the lightness of his inner\\r\\nraiment--threw back his judicial robe and displayed the dress which\\r\\nseveral persons then present had seen him wear at Lady Castlereagh\\'s\\r\\nball. Ere the spectators recovered from their first surprise, Lord\\r\\nNorbury, quite unconscious of his indecorum, had begun to pass sentence\\r\\nof death on a gang of prisoners, speaking to them in a solemn voice that\\r\\ncontrasted painfully with the inappropriateness of his costume.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following bright and picturesque sentence, Dr. Dibdin gives a\\r\\nlife-like portrait of Erskine, whose personal vanity was only equalled\\r\\nby the egotism which often gave piquancy to his orations, and never\\r\\nlessened their effect:--\"Cocked hats and ruffles, with satin\\r\\nsmall-clothes and silk stockings, at this time constituted the usual\\r\\nevening dress. Erskine, though a good deal shorter than his brethren,\\r\\nsomehow always seemed to take the lead both in pace and in discourse,\\r\\nand shouts of laughter would frequently follow his dicta. Among the\\r\\nsurrounding promenaders, he and the one-armed Mingay seemed to be the\\r\\nmain objects of attraction. Towards evening, it was the fashion for the\\r\\nleading counsel to promenade during the summer in the Temple Gardens,\\r\\nand I usually formed one in the thronging mall of loungers and\\r\\nspectators. I had analysed Blackstone, and wished to publish it under a\\r\\ndedication to Mr. Erskine. Having requested the favor of an interview,\\r\\nhe received me graciously at breakfast before nine, attired in the smart\\r\\ndress of the times, a dark green coat, scarlet waistcoat, and silk\\r\\nbreeches. He left his coffee, stood the whole time looking at the chart\\r\\nI had cut in copper, and appeared much gratified. On leaving him, a\\r\\nchariot-and-four drew up to wheel him to some provincial town on a\\r\\nspecial retainer. He was then coining money as fast as his chariot\\r\\nwheels rolled along.\" Erskine\\'s advocacy was marked by that attention to\\r\\ntrifles which has often contributed to the success of distinguished\\r\\nartists. His special retainers frequently took him to parts of the\\r\\ncountry where he was a stranger, and required him to make eloquent\\r\\nspeeches in courts which his voice had never tested. It was his custom\\r\\non reaching the town where he would have to plead on the following day,\\r\\nto visit the court over-night, and examine its arrangements, so that\\r\\nwhen the time for action arrived he might address the jury from the most\\r\\nfavorable spot in the chamber. He was a theatrical speaker, and omitted\\r\\nno pains to secure theatrical effect. It was noticed that he never\\r\\nappeared within the bar until the _cause célèbre_ had been called; and\\r\\na buzz of excitement and anxious expectation testified the eagerness of\\r\\nthe assembled crowd to _see_, as well as to hear, the celebrated\\r\\nadvocate. Every article of his bar costume received his especial\\r\\nconsideration; artifice could be discerned in the modulations of his\\r\\nvoice, the expressions of his countenance, and the movements of his\\r\\nentire body; but the coldest observer did not detect the artifice until\\r\\nit had stirred his heart. Rumor unjustly asserted that he never uttered\\r\\nan impetuous peroration which he had not frequently rehearsed in private\\r\\nbefore a mirror. About the cut and curls of his wigs, their texture and\\r\\ncolor, he was very particular: and the hands which he extended in\\r\\nentreaty towards British juries were always cased in lemon-colored kid\\r\\ngloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nErskine was not more noticeable for the foppishness of his dress than\\r\\nwas Lord Kenyon for a sordid attire. Whilst he was a leading advocate\\r\\nwithin the bar, Lord Kenyon\\'s ordinary costume would have disgraced a\\r\\ncopying clerk; and during his later years, it was a question amongst\\r\\nbarristers whether his breeches were made of velvet or leather. The wits\\r\\nmaintained that when he kissed hands upon his elevation to the\\r\\nAttorney\\'s place, he went to court in a second-hand suit purchased from\\r\\nLord Stormont\\'s _valet_. In the letter attributed to him by a clever\\r\\nwriter in the \\'Rolliad,\\' he is made to say--\"My income has been cruelly\\r\\nestimated at seven, or, as some will have it, eight thousand pounds per\\r\\nannum. I shall save myself the mortification of denying that I am rich,\\r\\nand refer you to the constant habits and whole tenor of my life. The\\r\\nproof to my friends is easy. My tailor\\'s bill for the last fifteen years\\r\\nis a record of the most indisputable authority. Malicious souls may\\r\\ndirect you, perhaps, to Lord Stormont\\'s _valet de chambre_, and can\\r\\nvouch the anecdote that on the day when I kissed hands for my\\r\\nappointment to the office of Attorney General, I appeared in a laced\\r\\nwaistcoat that once belonged to his master. I bought the waistcoat, but\\r\\ndespise the insinuation; nor is this the only instance in which I am\\r\\nobliged to diminish my wants and apportion them to my very limited\\r\\nmeans. Lady K---- will be my witness that until my last appointment I\\r\\nwas an utter stranger to the luxury of a pocket-handkerchief.\" The\\r\\npocket-handkerchief which then came into his possession was supposed to\\r\\nhave been found in the pocket of the second-hand waistcoat; and Jekyll\\r\\nalways maintained that, as it was not considered in the purchase, it\\r\\nremained the valet\\'s property, and did not pass into the lawyer\\'s\\r\\nrightful possession. This was the only handkerchief which Lord Kenyon is\\r\\nsaid to have ever possessed, and Lord Ellenborough alluded to it when,\\r\\nin a conversation that turned upon the economy which the income-tax\\r\\nwould necessitate in all ranks of life, he observed--\"Lord Kenyon, who\\r\\nis not very nice, intends to meet the crisis by laying down his\\r\\nhandkerchief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf his lordship\\'s way of getting through seasons of catarrh without a\\r\\nhandkerchief, there are several stories that would scarcely please the\\r\\nfastidious readers of this volume.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf his two wigs (one considerably less worn than the other), and of his\\r\\ntwo hats (the better of which would not have greatly disfigured an old\\r\\nclothesman, whilst the worse would have been of service to a\\r\\nprofessional scarecrow), Lord Kenyon took jealous care. The inferior wig\\r\\nwas always worn with the better hat, and the more dilapidated hat with\\r\\nthe superior wig; and it was noticed that when he appeared in court with\\r\\nthe shabbier wig he never removed his _chapeau_; whereas, on the days\\r\\nwhen he sat in his more decent wig, he pushed his old cocked hat out of\\r\\nsight. In the privacy of his house and in his carriage, whenever he\\r\\ntraveled beyond the limits of town, he used to lay aside wig and hat,\\r\\nand cover his head with an old red night-cap. Concerning his great-coat,\\r\\nthe original blackness of which had been tempered by long usage into a\\r\\nfuscous green, capital tales were fabricated. The wits could not spare\\r\\neven his shoes. \"Once,\" Dr. Didbin gravely narrated, \"in the case of an\\r\\naction brought for the non-fulfillment of a contract on a large scale\\r\\nfor shoes, the question mainly was, whether or not they were well and\\r\\nsoundly made, and with the best materials. A number of witnesses were\\r\\ncalled, one of them, a first-rate character in the gentle craft, being\\r\\nclosely questioned, returned contradictory answers, when the Chief\\r\\nJustice observed, pointing to his own shoes, which were regularly\\r\\nbestridden by the broad silver buckle of the day, \\'Were the shoes\\r\\nanything like these?\\' \\'No, my lord,\\' replied the evidence, \\'they were a\\r\\ngood deal better and more genteeler.\\'\" Dr. Didbin is at needless pains\\r\\nto assure his readers that the shoemaker\\'s answer was followed by\\r\\nuproarious laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART V.\\r\\n\\r\\nMUSIC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PIANO IN CHAMBERS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Inns of Court, even more often than in the colleges of Oxford and\\r\\nCambridge, musical instruments and performances are regarded by severe\\r\\nstudents with aversion and abhorrence. Mr. Babbage will live in peace\\r\\nand charity with the organ-grinders who are continually doing him an\\r\\nunfriendly turn before the industrious conveyancer on the first floor\\r\\nwill pray for the welfare of \\'that fellow upstairs\\' who daily practises\\r\\nthe flute or cornopean from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. The \\'Wandering Minstrels\\'\\r\\nand their achievements are often mentioned with respect in the western\\r\\ndrawing-rooms of London; but if the gentlemen who form that\\r\\ndistinguished _troupe_ of amateur performers wish to sacrifice their\\r\\npresent popularity and take a leading position amongst the social\\r\\nnuisances of the period, they should migrate from the district which\\r\\ndelights to honor them to chambers in Old Square, Lincoln\\'s Inn, and\\r\\ngive morning concerts every day of term time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking lawyers feel warmly on this subject, maintaining that no man\\r\\nshould be permitted to be an _amateur_-barrister and an\\r\\n_amateur_-musician at the same time, and holding that law-students with\\r\\na turn for wind-instruments should, like vermin, be hunted down and\\r\\nknocked on the head--without law. Strange stories might be told of the\\r\\ndiscords and violent deeds to which music has given rise in the four\\r\\nInns. In the last century many a foolish fellow was \\'put up\\' at ten\\r\\npaces, because he refused to lay down an ophicleide; even as late as\\r\\nGeorge IV.\\'s time death has followed from an inordinate addiction to the\\r\\nviolin; and it was but the other day that the introduction of a piano\\r\\ninto a house in Carey Street led to the destruction of three close and\\r\\nwarm friendships.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo alive are lawyers to the frightful consequences of a wholesale\\r\\nexhibition of melodious irritants, that a natural love of order and\\r\\ndesire for self-preservation has prompted them to raise numerous\\r\\nobstructions to the free development of musical science in their\\r\\npeculiar localities of town. In the Inns of Court and Chancery Lane\\r\\nprofessional etiquette forbids barristers and solicitors to play upon\\r\\norgans, harmoniums, pianos, violins, or other stringed instruments,\\r\\ndrums, trumpets, cymbals, shawms, bassoons, triangles, castanets or any\\r\\nother bony devices for the production of noise, flageolets, hautboys, or\\r\\nany other sort of boys--between the hours of 9 A.M. and 6 P.M. And this\\r\\nrule of etiquette is supported by various special conditions introduced\\r\\ninto the leases by which the tenants hold much of the local house\\r\\nproperty. Under some landlords, a tenant forfeits his lease if he\\r\\nindulges in any pursuit that causes annoyance to his immediate\\r\\nneighbors; under others, every occupant of a set of chambers binds\\r\\nhimself not to play any musical instrument therein, save between the\\r\\nhours of 9 A.M. and 12 P.M.; and in more than one clump of chambers,\\r\\nsituated within a stone\\'s throw from Chancery Lane, glee-singing is not\\r\\npermitted at any period of the four-and-twenty hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the pursuit of harmony is a dangerous pastime for young lawyers\\r\\ncannot be questioned, although a long list might be given of cases where\\r\\nmusical barristers have gained the confidence of many clients, and\\r\\neventually raised themselves to the bench. A piano is a treacherous\\r\\ncompanion for the student who can touch, it deftly--dangerous as an idle\\r\\nfriend, whose wit is ever brilliant; fascinating as a beautiful woman,\\r\\nwhose smile is always fresh; deceptive as the drug which seems to\\r\\ninvigorate, whilst in reality it is stealing away the intellectual\\r\\npowers. Every persevering worker knows how large a portion of his hard\\r\\nwork has been done \\'against the grain,\\' and in spite of strong\\r\\ninclinations to indolence--in hours when pleasant voices could have\\r\\nseduced him from duty, and any plausible excuse for indulgence would\\r\\nhave been promptly accepted. In the piano these pleasant voices are\\r\\nconstantly present, and it can always show good reason--why reluctant\\r\\nindustry should relax its exertions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BATTLE OF THE ORGANS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas More and Lord Bacon--the two most illustrious laymen who have\\r\\nheld the Great Seal of England--were notable musicians; and many\\r\\nsubsequent Keepers and Chancellors are scarcely less famous for love of\\r\\nharmonious sounds than for judicial efficiency. Lord Keeper Guildford\\r\\nwas a musical amateur, and notwithstanding his low esteem of literature\\r\\ncondescended to write about melody. Lord Jeffreys was a good\\r\\nafter-dinner vocalist, and was esteemed a high authority on questions\\r\\nconcerning instrumental performance. Lord Camden was an operatic\\r\\ncomposer; and Lord Thurlow studied thorough-bass, in order that he might\\r\\ndirect the musical exercises of his children.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn moments of depression More\\'s favorite solace was the viol; and so\\r\\ngreatly did he value musical accomplishments in women, that he not only\\r\\ninstructed his first and girlish wife to play on various instruments,\\r\\nbut even prevailed on the sour Mistress Alice Middleton \"to take lessons\\r\\non the lute, the cithara, the viol, the monochord, and the flute, which\\r\\nshe daily practised to him.\" But More\\'s love of music was expressed\\r\\nstill more forcibly in the zeal with which he encouraged and took part\\r\\nin the choral services of Chelsea Church. Throughout his residence at\\r\\nChelsea, Sir Thomas was a regular attendant at the church, and during\\r\\nhis tenure of the seals he not only delighted to chant the appointed\\r\\npsalms, but used to don a white surplice, and take his place among the\\r\\nchoristers. Having invited the Duke of Norfolk to dine with him, the\\r\\nChancellor prepared himself for the enjoyment of that great peer\\'s\\r\\nsociety by attending divine service, and he was still occupied with his\\r\\nreligious exercises when his Grace of Norfolk entered the church, and to\\r\\nhis inexpressible astonishment saw the keeper of the king\\'s conscience\\r\\nin the flowing raiment of a chorister, and heard him give \"Glory to God\\r\\nin the highest!\" as though he were a hired singer. \"God\\'s body! God\\'s\\r\\nbody! My Lord Chancellor a parish clerk?--a parish clerk?\" was the\\r\\nduke\\'s testy expostulation with the Chancellor. Whereupon More, with\\r\\ngentle gravity, answered, \"Nay; your grace may not think that the\\r\\nking--your master and mine--will with me, for serving his Master, be\\r\\noffended, and thereby account his office dishonored.\" Not only was it\\r\\nMore\\'s custom to sing in the church choir, but he used also to bear a\\r\\ncross in religious processions; and on being urged to mount horse when\\r\\nhe followed the rood in Rogation week round the parish boundaries, he\\r\\nanswered, \"It beseemeth not the servant to follow his master prancing on\\r\\na cock-horse, his master going on foot.\" Few incidents in Sir Thomas\\r\\nMore\\'s remarkable career point more forcibly to the vast difference\\r\\nbetween the social manners of the sixteenth century and those of the\\r\\npresent day. If Lord Chelmsford were to recreate himself with leading\\r\\nthe choristers in Margaret Street, and after service were seen walking\\r\\nhomewards in an ecclesiastical dress, it is more than probable that\\r\\npublic opinion would declare him a fit companion for the lunatics of\\r\\nwhose interests he has been made the official guardian. Society felt\\r\\nsome surprise as well as gratification when Sir Roundell Palmer recently\\r\\npublished his \\'Book of Praise;\\' but if the Attorney General, instead of\\r\\nprinting his select hymns had seen fit to exemplify their beauties with\\r\\nhis own voice from the stall of a church-singer, the piety of his\\r\\nconduct would have scarcely reconciled Lord Palmerston to its dangerous\\r\\neccentricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst Elizabethan lawyers, Chief Justice Dyer was by no means singular\\r\\nfor his love of music, though Whetstone\\'s lines have given exceptional\\r\\ncelebrity to his melodious proficiency:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"For publique good, when care had cloid his minde,\\r\\n     The only joye, for to repose his sprights,\\r\\n   Was musique sweet, which showd him well inclind;\\r\\n     For he doth in musique much delight,\\r\\n     A conscience hath disposed to do most right:\\r\\n   The reason is, her sound within our eare,\\r\\n   A sympathie of heaven we thinke we heare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLike James Dyer, Francis Bacon found music a pleasant and salutary\\r\\npastime, when he was fatigued by the noisy contentions of legal practice\\r\\nor by strenuous application to philosophic pursuits. A perfect master of\\r\\nthe science of melody, Lord Bacon explained its laws with a clearness\\r\\nwhich has satisfied competent judges that he was familiar with the\\r\\npractice as well as the theories of harmony; but few passages of his\\r\\nworks display more agreeably his personal delight and satisfaction in\\r\\nmusical exercise and investigation than that section of the \\'Natural\\r\\nHistory,\\' wherein he says, \"And besides I practice as I do advise; which\\r\\nis, after long inquiry of things immersed in matter, to interpose some\\r\\nsubject which is immateriate or less materiate; such as this of sounds:\\r\\nto the end that the intellect may be rectified and become not partial.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA theorist as well as performer, the Lord Keeper Guilford enunciated his\\r\\nviews regarding the principles of melody in \\'A Philosophical Essay of\\r\\nMusick, Directed to a Friend\\'--a treatise that was published without the\\r\\nauthor\\'s name, by Martin, the printer to the Royal Society, in the year\\r\\n1677, at which time the future keeper was Chief Justice of the Common\\r\\nPleas. The merits of the tract are not great; but it displays the\\r\\nsubtlety and whimsical quaintness of the musical lawyer, who performed\\r\\non several instruments, was very vain of a feeble voice, and used to\\r\\nattribute much of his professional success to the constant study of\\r\\nmusic that marked every period of his life. \"I have heard him say,\"\\r\\nRoger records, \"that if he had not enabled himself by these studies, and\\r\\nparticular his practice of music upon his bass or lyra viol (which he\\r\\nused to touch lute-fashion upon his knee), to divert himself alone, he\\r\\nhad never been a lawyer. His mind was so airy and volatile he could not\\r\\nhave kept his chamber if he must needs be there, staked down purely to\\r\\nthe drudgery of the law, whether in study or practice; and yet upon\\r\\nsuch a leaden proposition, so painful to brisk spirits, all the success\\r\\nof the profession, regularly pursued, depends.\" His first acquaintance\\r\\nwith melodious art was made at Cambridge, where in his undergraduate\\r\\ndays he took lessons on the viol. At this same period he \"had the\\r\\nopportunity of practice so much in his grandfather\\'s and father\\'s\\r\\nfamilies, where the entertainment of music in full concert was solemn\\r\\nand frequent, that he outdid all his teachers, and became one of the\\r\\nneatest violinists of his time.\" Scarcely in consistence with this\\r\\ndeclaration of the Lord Keeper\\'s proficiency on the violin is a later\\r\\npassage of the biography, where Roger says that his brother \"attempted\\r\\nthe violin, being ambitious of the prime part in concert, but soon found\\r\\nthat he began such a difficult art too late.\" It is, however, certain\\r\\nthat the eminent lawyer in the busiest passages of his laborious life\\r\\nfound time for musical practice, and that besides his essay on music, he\\r\\ncontributed to his favorite art several compositions which were\\r\\nperformed in private concert-rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharing in the musical tastes of his family, Roger North, the\\r\\nbiographer, was the _friend_ who used to touch the harpsichord that\\r\\nstood at the door of the Lord Keeper\\'s bedchamber; and when political\\r\\nchanges had extinguished his hopes of preferment, he found consolation\\r\\nin music and literature. Retiring to his seat in Norfolk, Roger fitted\\r\\nup a concert-room with instruments that roused the astonishment of\\r\\ncountry squires, and an organ that was extolled by critical professors\\r\\nfor the sweetness of its tones. In that seclusion, where he lived to\\r\\nextreme old age, the lettered lawyer composed the greater part of those\\r\\nwritings which have rendered him familiar to the present generation. Of\\r\\nhis \\'Memoirs of Musick,\\' readers are not accustomed to speak so\\r\\ngratefully as of his biographies; but the curious sketch which Dr.\\r\\nRimbault edited and for the first time published in 1846, is worthy of\\r\\nperusal, and will maintain a place on the shelves of literary collectors\\r\\nby the side of his brother\\'s \\'Essay.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that treatise Roger alludes to a contest which in the reigns of\\r\\nCharles II. and James II. agitated the musicians of London, divided the\\r\\nTemplars into two hostile parties, and for a considerable time gave rise\\r\\nto quarrels in every quarter of the town. All this disturbance resulted\\r\\nfrom \"a competition for an organ in the Temple church, for which the two\\r\\ncompetitors, the best artists in Europe, Smith and Harris, were but just\\r\\nnot ruined.\" The struggle thus mentioned in the \\'Memoirs of Musick\\' is\\r\\nso comic an episode in the story of London life, and has been the\\r\\noccasion of so much error amongst writers, that it claims brief\\r\\nrestatement in the present chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, 1682, the Benchers of the Temples, wishing to obtain for\\r\\ntheir church an organ of superlative excellence, invited Father Smith\\r\\nand Renatus Harris to compete for the honor of supplying the instrument.\\r\\nThe masters of the benchers pledged themselves that \"if each of these\\r\\nexcellent artists would set up an organ in one of the halls belonging to\\r\\neither of the societies, they would have erected in their church that\\r\\nwhich, in the greatest number of excellencies, deserved the preference.\"\\r\\nFor more than twenty years Father Smith had been the first organ-builder\\r\\nin England; and the admirable qualities of his instruments testify to\\r\\nhis singular ability. A German artist (in his native country called\\r\\nBernard Schmidt, but in London known as Father Smith), he had\\r\\nestablished himself in the English capital as early as the summer of\\r\\n1660; and gaining the cordial patronage of Charles II., he and his two\\r\\ngrand-nephews soon became leaders of their craft. Father Smith built\\r\\norgans for Westminster Abbey, for the Church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields,\\r\\nfor St. Margaret\\'s Church, Westminster, for Durham Cathedral, and for\\r\\nother sacred buildings. In St. Paul\\'s Cathedral he placed the organ\\r\\nwhich Wren disdainfully designated a \"box of whistles;\" and dying in\\r\\n1708, he left his son-in-law, Christopher Schreider, to complete the\\r\\norgan which still stands in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge.\\r\\nBut notwithstanding his greatness, Father Smith had rivals; his first\\r\\nrival being Harris the Elder, who died in 1672, his second being Renatus\\r\\nHarris, or Harris the Younger. The elder Harris never caused Smith much\\r\\ndiscomfort; but his son, Renatus, was a very clever fellow, and a strong\\r\\nparty of fashionable _connoisseurs_ declared that he was greatly\\r\\nsuperior to the German. Such was the position of these two rivals when\\r\\nthe benchers made their proposal, which was eagerly accepted by the\\r\\nartificers, each of whom saw in it an opportunity for covering his\\r\\nantagonist with humiliation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men went to work: and within fourteen months their instruments were\\r\\nready for competition. Smith finished work before Harris, and prevailed\\r\\non the benchers to let him place his organ in the Temple church, well\\r\\nknowing that the powers of the instrument could be much more readily and\\r\\neffectively displayed in the church than in either of the dining-halls.\\r\\nThe exact site where he fixed his organ is unknown, but the careful\\r\\nauthor of \\'A Few Notes on the Temple Organ, 1859,\\' is of opinion that it\\r\\nwas put up \"on the screen between the round and oblong churches--the\\r\\nposition occupied by the organ until the present organ-chamber was\\r\\nbuilt, and the organ removed there during the progress of the complete\\r\\nrestoration of the church in the year 1843.\" No sooner had Harris\\r\\nfinished his organ, than, following Father Smith\\'s example, he asked\\r\\nleave of the benchers to erect it within the church. Harris\\'s petition\\r\\nto this effect bears date May 26, 1684; and soon afterwards the organ\\r\\nwas \"set up in the Church on the south side of the Communion Table.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth organs being thus stationed under the roof of the church, the\\r\\ncommittee of benchers appointed to decide on their relative merits\\r\\ndeclared themselves ready to listen. The trial began, but many\\r\\nmonths--ay, some years--elapsed ere it came to an end. On either side\\r\\nthe credit of the manufacturer was sustained by execution of the highest\\r\\norder of art. Father Smith\\'s organ was handled alternately by Purcell\\r\\nand Dr. Blow; and Draghi, the queen\\'s organist, did his best to secure a\\r\\nverdict for Renatus Harris. Of course the employment of these eminent\\r\\nmusicians greatly increased the number of persons who felt personal\\r\\ninterest in the contest. Whilst the pupils and admirers of Purcell and\\r\\nBlow were loud in declaring that Smith\\'s organ ought to win, Draghi\\'s\\r\\nfriends were equally sure that the organ touched by his expert fingers\\r\\nought not to lose. Discussion soon became violent; and in every\\r\\nprofession, clique, coterie of the town, supporters of Smith wrangled\\r\\nwith supporters of Harris. Like the battle of the Gauges in our time,\\r\\nthe battle of the Organs was the grand topic with every class of\\r\\nsociety, at Court and on \\'Change, in coffee-houses and at ordinaries.\\r\\nAgain and again the organs were tested in the hearing of dense and\\r\\nfashionable congregations; and as often the judicial committee was\\r\\nunable to come to a decision. The hesitation of the judges put oil upon\\r\\nthe fire; for Smith\\'s friends, indignant at the delay, asserted that\\r\\ncertain members of the committee were bound to Harris by corrupt\\r\\nconsiderations--an accusation that was retorted by the other side with\\r\\nequal warmth and want of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the squabble had been protracted through many months, Harris\\r\\ncreated a diversion by challenging Father Smith to make additional\\r\\nreed-stops within a given time. The challenge was accepted; and\\r\\nforthwith the Father went to work and made Vox Humana, Cremorne, Double\\r\\nCourtel, or Double Bassoon, and other stops. A day was appointed for the\\r\\nrenewal of the contest; but party feeling ran so high, that during the\\r\\nnight preceding the appointed day a party of hot-headed Harrissians\\r\\nbroke into the Temple Church, and cut Smith\\'s bellows--so that on the\\r\\nfollowing morning his organ was of no more service than an old\\r\\nlinen-press. A row ensued; and in the ardor of debate swords were drawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June, 1685, the benchers of the Middle Temple, made a written\\r\\ndeclaration in favor of Father Smith, and urged that his organ should be\\r\\nforthwith accepted. Strongly and rather discourteously worded, this\\r\\ndeclaration gave offence to the benchers of the Inner Temple, who\\r\\nregarded it as an attempt at dictation; and on June 22, 1685, they\\r\\nrecommended the appointment of another committee with powers to decide\\r\\nthe contest. Declining to adopt this suggestion, the Middle Temple\\r\\nbenchers reiterated their high opinion of Smith\\'s instrument. On this\\r\\nthe Battle of the Organs became a squabble between the two Temples; and\\r\\nthe outside public, laughing over the quarrel of the lawyers, expressed\\r\\na hope that honest men would get their own since the rogues had fallen\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, when the organ-builders had well-nigh ruined each other, and\\r\\nthe town had grown weary of the dispute, the Inner Temple yielded\\r\\nsomewhere about the beginning of 1688--at an early date of which year\\r\\nSmith received a sum of money in part payment for his organ. On May 27th\\r\\nof the same year, Mr. Pigott was appointed organist. After its rejection\\r\\nby the Temple, Renatus Harris divided his organ into two, and having\\r\\nsent the one part to the cathedral of Christ\\'s Church, Dublin, he set up\\r\\nthe other part in the church of St. Andrew, Holborn. Three years after\\r\\nhis disappointment, Renatus Harris was tried at the Old Bailey for a\\r\\npolitical offence, the nature of which may be seen from the following\\r\\nentry in Narcissus Luttrell\\'s Diary:--\"April, 1691. The Sessions have\\r\\nbeen at the Old Bailey, where these persons, Renatus Harris, John Watts,\\r\\nWilliam Rutland, Henry Gandy, and Thomas Tysoe, were tried at the Old\\r\\nBailey for setting up policies of insurance that Dublin would be in the\\r\\nhands of some other king than their present majesties by Christmas next:\\r\\nthe jury found them guilty of a misdemeanor.\" For this offence Renatus\\r\\nHarris was fined £200, and was required to give security for his good\\r\\nconduct until Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn erroneous tradition assigns to Lord Jeffreys the honor of bringing\\r\\nthe Battle of the Organs to a conclusion, and writers improving upon\\r\\nthis tradition, have represented that Jeffreys acted as sole umpire\\r\\nbetween the contendants. In his \\'History of Music,\\' Dr. Burney, to whom\\r\\nthe prevalence of this false impression is mainly due, observes--\"At\\r\\nlength the decision was left to Lord Chief Justice Jeffries, afterwards\\r\\nKing James the Second\\'s pliant Chancellor, who was of that society (the\\r\\nInner Temple), and he terminated the controversy in favor of Father\\r\\nSmith; so that Harris\\'s organ was taken away without loss of reputation,\\r\\nhaving so long pleased and puzzled better judges than Jefferies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCareful inquirers have ascertained that Harris\\'s organ did not go to\\r\\nWolverhampton, but to Dublin and St. Andrew\\'s Holborn, part of it being\\r\\nsent to the one, and part to the other place. It is certain that Jeffrys\\r\\nwas not chosen to act as umpire in 1681, for the benchers did not make\\r\\ntheir original proposal to the rival builders until February, 1682; and\\r\\nyears passed between that date and the termination of the squabble. When\\r\\nBurney wrote:--\"At length the decision was left to Lord Chief Justice\\r\\nJefferies, _afterwards King James II.\\'s pliant Chancellor_,\" the\\r\\nmusician was unaware that the squabble was still at white heat whilst\\r\\nJeffreys occupied the woolsack. On his return from the Western Campaign,\\r\\nJeffreys received the seals in September, 1685, whereas the dispute\\r\\nabout the organs did not terminate till the opening of 1688, or at\\r\\nearliest till the close of 1687. There is no authentic record in the\\r\\narchives of the Temples which supports, or in any way countenances, the\\r\\nstory that Jeffreys made choice of Smith\\'s instrument; but it is highly\\r\\nprobable that the Lord Chancellor exerted his influence with the Inner\\r\\nTemple (of which society he was a member), and induced the benchers, for\\r\\nthe sake of peace, to yield to the wishes of the Middle Temple. It is no\\r\\nless probable that his fine musical taste enabled him to see that the\\r\\nMiddle Temple benchers were in the right, and gave especial weight to\\r\\nhis words when he spoke against Harris\\'s instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Jeffreys delighted in music, he does not seem to have held its\\r\\nprofessors in high esteem. In the time of Charles II. musical artists of\\r\\nthe humbler grades liked to be styled \\'musitioners;\\' and on a certain\\r\\noccasion, when he was sitting as Recorder for the City of London, George\\r\\nJeffreys was greatly incensed by a witness who, in a pompous voice,\\r\\ncalled himself a musitioner. With a sneer the Recorder interposed--\"A\\r\\nmusitioner! I thought you were a fiddler!\" \"I am a musitioner,\" the\\r\\nviolinist answered, stoutly. \"Oh, indeed,\" croaked Jeffreys. \"That is\\r\\nvery important--highly important--extremely important! And pray, Mr.\\r\\nWitness, what is the difference between a musitioner and a fiddler?\"\\r\\nWith fortunate readiness the man answered, \"As much, sir, as there is\\r\\nbetween a pair of bag-pipes and a Recorder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA THICKNESS IN THE THROAT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date is September, 1805, and the room before us is a drawing-room in\\r\\na pleasant house at Brighton. The hot sun is beating down on cliff and\\r\\nterrace, beach and pier, on the downs behind the town and the sparkling\\r\\nsea in front. The brightness of the blue sky is softened by white vapor\\r\\nthat here and there resembles a vast curtain of filmy gauze, but nowhere\\r\\nhas gathered into visible masses of hanging cloud. In the distance the\\r\\nsea is murmuring audibly, and through the screened windows, together\\r\\nwith the drowsy hum of the languid waves, comes a light breeze that is\\r\\ninvigorating, notwithstanding its sensible warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides ourselves there are but two people in the room: a gentlewoman\\r\\nwho has said farewell to youth, but not to feminine grade and delicacy;\\r\\nand an old man, who is lying on a sofa near one of the open windows,\\r\\nwhilst his daughter plays passages of Handel\\'s music on the piano-forte.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man wears the dress of an obsolete school of English gentlemen;\\r\\na large brown wig with three rows of curls, the lowest row resting on\\r\\nthe curve of his shoulders; a loose grey coat, notable for the size of\\r\\nits cuffs and the bigness of its heavy buttons; ruffles at his wrists,\\r\\nand frills of fine lace below his roomy cravat. These are the most\\r\\nconspicuous articles of his costume, but not the most striking points of\\r\\nhis aspect. Over his huge, pallid, cadaverous, furrowed face there is an\\r\\nair singularly expressive of exhaustion and power, of debility and\\r\\nlatent strength--an air that says to sensitive beholders, \"This\\r\\nprostrate veteran was once a giant amongst giants; his fires are dying\\r\\nout; but the old magnificent courage and ability will never altogether\\r\\nleave him until the beatings of his heart shall have quite ceased: touch\\r\\nhim with foolishness or disrespect, and his rage will be terrible.\"\\r\\nStanding here we can see his prodigious bushy eyebrows, that are as\\r\\nwhite as driven snow, and under them we can see the large black eyes,\\r\\nbeneath the angry fierceness of which hundreds of proud British peers,\\r\\nassembled in their council-chamber, have trembled like so many whipped\\r\\nschoolboys. There is no lustre in them now, and their habitual\\r\\nexpression is one of weariness and profound indifference to the world--a\\r\\nlook that is deeply pathetic and depressing, until some transient cause\\r\\nof irritation or the words of a sprightly talker rouse him into\\r\\nanimation. But the most noticeable quality of his face is its look of\\r\\nextreme age. Only yesterday a keen observer said of him, \"Lord Thurlow\\r\\nis, I believe, only seventy-four; and from his appearance I should think\\r\\nhim a hundred years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo quiet is the reclining form, that the pianist thinks her father must\\r\\nbe sleeping. Turning on the music-stool to get a view of his\\r\\ncountenance, and to satisfy herself as to his state, she makes a false\\r\\nnote, when, quick as the blunder, the brown wig turns upon the\\r\\npillow--the furrowed face is presented to her observation, and an\\r\\nelectric brightness fills the big black eyes, as the veteran, with deep\\r\\nrolling tones, reproves her carelessness:--\"What are you doing?--what\\r\\nare you doing? I had almost forgotten the world. Play that piece again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwelve months more--and the lady will be playing Handel\\'s music on that\\r\\nsame instrument; but the old man will not be a listener.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Brighton, in 1805, let readers transport themselves to Canterbury\\r\\nin 1776, and let them enter a barber\\'s shop, hard by Canterbury\\r\\nCathedral. It is a primitive shop, with the red and white pole over the\\r\\ndoor, and a modest display of wigs and puff-boxes in the window. A small\\r\\nshop, but, notwithstanding its smallness, the best shop of its kind in\\r\\nCanterbury; and its lean, stiff, exceedingly respectable master is a man\\r\\nof good repute in the cathedral town. His hands have, ere now, powdered\\r\\nthe Archbishop\\'s wig, and he is specially retained by the chief clergy\\r\\nof the city and neighborhood to keep their false hair in order, and trim\\r\\nthe natural tresses of their children. Not only have the dignitaries of\\r\\nthe cathedral taken the worthy barber under their special protection,\\r\\nbut they have extended to his little boy Charles, a demure, prim lad,\\r\\nwho is at this present time a pupil in the King\\'s School, to which\\r\\nacademy clerical interest gained him admission. The lad is in his\\r\\nfourteenth year; and Dr. Osmund Beauvoir, the master of the school,\\r\\ngives him so good a character for industry and dutiful demeanor, that\\r\\nsome of the cathedral ecclesiastics have resolved to make the little\\r\\nfellow\\'s fortune--by placing him in the office of a Chorister. There is\\r\\na vacant place in the cathedral choir; and the boy who is lucky enough\\r\\nto receive the appointment will be provided for munificently. He will\\r\\nforthwith have a maintenance, and in course of time his salary will be\\r\\n£70 per annum.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the last fortnight the barber has been in great and constant\\r\\nexcitement--hoping that his little boy will obtain this valuable piece\\r\\nof preferment; persuading himself that the lad\\'s thickness of voice,\\r\\nconcerning which the choir-master speaks with aggravating persistence,\\r\\nis a matter of no real importance; fearing that the friends of another\\r\\ncontemporary boy, who is said by the choir-master to have an exceedingly\\r\\nmellifluous voice, may defeat his paternal aspirations. The momentous\\r\\nquestion agitates many humble homes in Canterbury; and whilst Mr.\\r\\nAbbott, the barber, is encouraged to hope the best for his son, the\\r\\nrelatives and supporters of the contemporary boy are urging him not to\\r\\ndespair. Party spirit prevails on either side--Mr. Abbott\\'s family\\r\\nassociates maintaining that the contemporary boy\\'s higher notes resemble\\r\\nthose of a penny whistle; whilst the contemporary boy\\'s father, with\\r\\nmuch satire and some justice, murmurs that \"old Abbott, who is the\\r\\ngossip-monger of the parsons, wants to push his son into a place for\\r\\nwhich there is a better candidate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-day is the eventful day when the election will be made. Even now,\\r\\nwhilst Abbott, the barber, is trimming a wig at his shop window, and\\r\\nlistening to the hopeful talk of an intimate neighbor, his son Charley\\r\\nis chanting the Old Hundredth before the whole chapter. When Charley has\\r\\nbeen put through his vocal paces, the contemporary boy is requested to\\r\\nsing. Whereupon that clear-throated competitor, sustained by justifiable\\r\\nself-confidence and a new-laid egg which he had sucked scarcely a minute\\r\\nbefore he made his bow to their reverences, sings out with such richness\\r\\nand compass that all the auditors recognize his great superiority.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre ten more minutes have passed Charley Abbot knows that he has lost\\r\\nthe election; and he hastens from the cathedral with quick steps.\\r\\nRunning into the shop he gives his father a look that tells the whole\\r\\nstory of--failure, and then the little fellow, unable to command his\\r\\ngrief, sits down upon the floor and sobs convulsively.\\r\\n\\r\\nFailure is often the first step to eminence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the boy gained the chorister\\'s place, he would have a cathedral\\r\\nservant all his days.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving failed to get it, he returned to the King\\'s School, went a poor\\r\\nscholar to Oxford, and fought his way to honor. He became Chief Justice\\r\\nof the King\\'s Bench, and a peer of the realm. Towards the close of his\\r\\nhonorable career Lord Tenterden attended service in the Cathedral of\\r\\nCanterbury, accompanied by Mr. Justice Richardson. When the ceremonial\\r\\nwas at an end the Chief Justice said to his friend--\"Do you see that old\\r\\nman there amongst the choristers? In him, brother Richardson, behold the\\r\\nonly being I ever envied: when at school in this town we were candidates\\r\\ntogether for a chorister\\'s place; he obtained it; and if I had gained my\\r\\nwish he might have been accompanying you as Chief Justice, and pointing\\r\\nme out as his old school-fellow, the singing man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART VI.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMATEUR THEATRICALS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nACTORS AT THE BAR.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years since the late Sergeant Wilkins was haranguing a crowd of\\r\\nenlightened electors from the hustings of a provincial borough, when a\\r\\nstentorian voice exclaimed, \"Go home, you rope-dancer!\" Disdaining to\\r\\nnotice the interruption, the orator continued his speech for fifty\\r\\nseconds, when the same voice again cried out, \"Go home, you\\r\\nrope-dancer!\" A roar of laughter followed the reiteration of the insult;\\r\\nand in less than two minutes thrice fifty unwashed blackguards were\\r\\nroaring with all the force of their lungs, \"Ah-h-h--Go home, you\\r\\nrope-dancer!\" Not slow to see the moaning of the words, the unabashed\\r\\nlawyer, who in his life had been a dramatic actor, replied with his\\r\\naccustomed readiness and effrontery. A young man unacquainted with mobs\\r\\nwould have descanted indignantly and with many theatrical flourishes on\\r\\nthe dignity and usefulness of the player\\'s vocation; an ordinary\\r\\ndemagogue would have frankly admitted the discourteous impeachment, and\\r\\npleaded in mitigation that he had always acted in leading parts and for\\r\\nhigh salaries. Sergeant Wilkins took neither of those courses, for he\\r\\nknew his audience, and was aware that his connection with the stage was\\r\\nan affair about which he had better say as little as possible. Instead\\r\\nof appealing to their generosity, or boasting of his histrionic\\r\\neminence, he threw himself broadly on their sense of humor. Drawing\\r\\nhimself up to his full height, the big, burly man advanced to the marge\\r\\nof the platform, and extending his right hand with an air of authority,\\r\\nrequested silence by the movement of his arm. The sign was instantly\\r\\nobeyed; for having enjoyed their laugh, the multitude wished for the\\r\\nrope-dancer\\'s explanation. As soon as the silence was complete, he drew\\r\\nback two paces, put himself in an oratorical _pose_, as though he were\\r\\nabout to speak, and then, disappointing the expectations of the\\r\\nassembly, deliberately raised forwards and upwards the skirts of his\\r\\nfrock-coat. Having thus arranged his drapery he performed a slow\\r\\ngyration--presenting his huge round shoulders and unwieldy legs to the\\r\\npopulace. When his back was turned to the crowd, he stooped and made a\\r\\nlow obeisance to his vacant chair, thereby giving the effect of\\r\\ncaricature to the outlines of his most protuberant and least honorable\\r\\npart. This pantomime lasted scarcely a minute; and before the spectators\\r\\ncould collect themselves to resent so extraordinary an affront, the\\r\\nsergeant once again faced them, and in a clear, rich, jovial tone\\r\\nexclaimed, \"_He_ called me a rope-dancer!--after what you have seen, do\\r\\nyou believe him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of the man who started the cry, every person in the\\r\\ndense multitude was convulsed with laughter; and till the end of the\\r\\nelection no turbulent rascal ventured to repeat the allusion to the\\r\\nsergeant\\'s former occupation. At a moment of embarrassment, Mr.\\r\\nDisraeli, in the course of one of his youthful candidatures, created a\\r\\ndiversion in his favor by telling a knot of unruly politicians that he\\r\\n_stood on his head_. With less wit, and much less decency, but with\\r\\nequal good fortune, Sergeant Wilkins took up his position on a baser\\r\\npart of his frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe electors who respected Mr. Wilkins because he was a successful\\r\\nbarrister, whilst they reproached him with having been a stage-player,\\r\\nwere unaware how close an alliance exists between the art of the actor\\r\\nand the art of the advocate. To lawyers of every grade and speciality\\r\\nthe histrionic faculty is a useful power; but to the advocate who wishes\\r\\nto sway the minds of jurors it is a necessary endowment. Comprising\\r\\nseveral distinct abilities, it not only enables the orator to rouse the\\r\\npassions and to play on the prejudices of his hearers, but it preserves\\r\\nhim from the errors of judgment, tone, emphasis--in short, from manifold\\r\\nblunders of indiscretion and tact by which verdicts are lost quite as\\r\\noften as through defect of evidence and merit. Like the dramatic\\r\\nperformer, the court-speaker, especially at the common law bar, has to\\r\\nassume various parts. Not only should he know the facts of his brief,\\r\\nbut he should thoroughly identify himself with the client for whom his\\r\\neloquence is displayed. On the theatrical stage mimetic business is cut\\r\\nup into specialities, men in most cases filling the parts of men, whilst\\r\\nactresses fill the parts of women; the young representing the\\r\\ncharacteristics of youth, whilst actors with special endowments simulate\\r\\nthe qualities of old age; some confining themselves to light and trivial\\r\\ncharacters, whilst others are never required to strut before the scenes\\r\\nwith hurried paces, or to speak in phrases that lack dignity and fine\\r\\nsentiment. But the popular advocate must in turn fill every _rôle_. If\\r\\nchildish simplicity be his client\\'s leading characteristic, his\\r\\nintonations will express pliancy and foolish confidence; or if it is\\r\\ndesirable that the jury should appreciate his client\\'s honesty of\\r\\npurpose, he speaks with a voice of blunt, bluff, manly frankness.\\r\\nWhatever quality the advocate may wish to represent as the client\\'s\\r\\ndistinctive characteristic, it must be suggested to the jury by mimetic\\r\\nartifice of the finest sort. Speaking of a famous counsel, an\\r\\nenthusiastic juryman once said to this writer--\"In my time I have heard\\r\\nSir Alexander in pretty nearly every part: I\\'ve heard him as an old man\\r\\nand a young woman; I have heard him when he has been a ship run down at\\r\\nsea, and when he has been an oil-factory in a state of conflagration;\\r\\nonce, when I was foreman of a jury, I saw him poison his intimate\\r\\nfriend, and another time he did the part of a pious bank director in a\\r\\nfashion that would have skinned the eyelids of Exeter Hall: he ain\\'t bad\\r\\nas a desolate widow with nine children, of which the eldest is under\\r\\neight years of age; but if ever I have to listen to him again, I should\\r\\nlike to see him as a young lady of good connexions who has been seduced\\r\\nby an officer of the Guards.\" In the days of his forensic triumphs Henry\\r\\nBrougham was remarkable for the mimetic power which enabled him to\\r\\ndescribe friend or foe by a few subtle turns of the voice. At a later\\r\\nperiod, long after he had left the bar, in compliance with a request\\r\\nthat he would return thanks for the bridesmaids at a wedding breakfast,\\r\\nhe observed, that \"doubtless he had been selected for the task in\\r\\nconsideration of his youth, beauty, and innocence.\" The laughter that\\r\\nfollowed this sally was of the sort which in poetic phraseology is\\r\\ncalled inextinguishable; and one of the wedding guests who heard the\\r\\njoke and the laughter, assures this writer that the storm of mirthful\\r\\napplause was chiefly due to the delicacy and sweetness of the\\r\\nintonations by which the speaker\\'s facile voice, with its old and once\\r\\nfamiliar art, made the audience realize the charms of youth, beauty and\\r\\ninnocence--charms which, so far as the lawyer\\'s wrinkled visage was\\r\\nconcerned, were conspicuous by their absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nEminent advocates have almost invariably possessed qualities that would\\r\\nhave made them successful mimics on the stage. For his mastery of\\r\\noratorical artifices Alexander Wedderburn was greatly indebted to\\r\\nSheridan, the lecturer on elocution, and to Macklin, the actor, from\\r\\nboth of whom he took lessons; and when he had dismissed his teachers and\\r\\nbecome a leader of the English bar he adhered to their rules, and daily\\r\\npractised before a looking-glass the facial tricks by which Macklin\\r\\ntaught him to simulate surprise or anger, indignation or triumph.\\r\\nErskine was a perfect master of dramatic effect, and much of his\\r\\nrichly-deserved success was due to the theatrical artifices with which\\r\\nhe played upon the passions of juries. At the conclusion of a long\\r\\noration he was accustomed to feign utter physical prostration, so that\\r\\nthe twelve gentlemen in the box, in their sympathy for his sufferings\\r\\nand their admiration for his devotion to the interests of his client,\\r\\nmight be impelled by generous emotion to return a favorable verdict.\\r\\nThus when he defended Hardy, hoarseness and fatigue so overpowered him\\r\\ntowards the close of his speech, that during the last ten minutes he\\r\\ncould not speak above a whisper, and in order that his whispers might be\\r\\naudible to the jury, the exhausted advocate advanced two steps nearer to\\r\\ntheir box, and then extended his pale face to their eager eyes. The\\r\\neffect of the artifice on the excited jury is said to have been great\\r\\nand enduring, although they were speedily enlightened as to the real\\r\\nnature of his apparent distress. No sooner had the advocate received the\\r\\nfirst plaudits of his theatre on the determination of his harangue, than\\r\\nthe multitude outside the court, taking up the acclamations which were\\r\\nheard within the building, expressed their feelings with such deafening\\r\\nclamor, and with so many signs of riotous intention, that Erskine was\\r\\nentreated to leave the court and soothe the passions of the mob with a\\r\\nfew words of exhortation. In compliance with this suggestion he left the\\r\\ncourt, and forthwith addressed the dense out-door assembly in clear,\\r\\nringing tones that were audible in Ludgate Hill, at one end of the Old\\r\\nBailey, and to the billowy sea of human heads that surged round St.\\r\\nSepulchre\\'s Church at the other extremity of the dismal thoroughfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the subsequent trial of John Horne Tooke, Sir John Scott, unwilling\\r\\nthat Erskine should enjoy a monopoly of theatrical artifice, endeavored\\r\\nto create a diversion in favor of the government by a display of those\\r\\nlachrymose powers, which Byron ridiculed in the following century. \"I\\r\\ncan endure anything but an attack on my good name,\" exclaimed the\\r\\nAttorney General, in reply to a criticism directed against his mode of\\r\\nconducting the prosecution; \"my good name is the little patrimony I have\\r\\nto leave to my children, and, with God\\'s help, gentlemen of the jury, I\\r\\nwill leave it to them unimpaired.\" As he uttered these words tears\\r\\nsuffused the eyes which, at a later period of the lawyer\\'s career, used\\r\\nto moisten the woolsack in the House of Lords--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Because the Catholics would not rise,\\r\\n   In spite of his prayers and his prophecies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment Horne Tooke, who persisted in regarding all the\\r\\ncircumstances of his perilous position as farcical, smiled at the\\r\\nlawyer\\'s outburst in silent amusement; but as soon as he saw a\\r\\nsympathetic brightness in the eyes of one of the jury, the dexterous\\r\\ndemagogue with characteristic humor and effrontery accused Sir John\\r\\nMitford, the Solicitor General, of needless sympathy with the\\r\\nsentimental disturbance of his colleague. \"Do you know what Sir John\\r\\nMitford is crying about?\" the prisoner inquired of the jury. \"He is\\r\\nthinking of the destitute condition of Sir John Scott\\'s children, and\\r\\nthe _little patrimony_ they are likely to divide among them.\" The jury\\r\\nand all present were not more tickled by the satire upon the Attorney\\r\\nGeneral than by the indignant surprise which enlivened the face of Sir\\r\\nJohn Mitford, who was not at all prone to tears, and had certainly\\r\\nmanifested no pity for John Scott\\'s forlorn condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE PLAY\\'S THE THING.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the example set by the nobility in their castles and civic\\r\\npalaces, the Inns of Court set apart certain days of the year for\\r\\nfeasting and revelry, and amongst the diversions with which the lawyers\\r\\nrecreated themselves at these periods of rejoicing, the rude\\r\\nPre-Shakespearian dramas took a prominent place. So far back as A.D.\\r\\n1431, the Masters of the Lincoln\\'s Inn Bench restricted the number of\\r\\nannual revels to four--\"one at the feast of All-Hallown, another at the\\r\\nfeast of St. Erkenwald; the third at the feast of the Purification of\\r\\nour Lady; and the 4th at Midsummer.\" The ceremonials of these holidays\\r\\nwere various; but the brief and sometimes unintelligible notices of the\\r\\nchroniclers give us sufficiently vivid and minute pictures of the\\r\\nboisterous jollity that marked the proceedings. Miracle plays and\\r\\nmoralities, dancing and music, fantastic processions and mad pranks,\\r\\nspurred on the hours that were not devoted to heavy meals and deep\\r\\npotations. In the merriments of the different Inns there was a pleasant\\r\\ndiversity--with regard to the duration and details of the\\r\\nentertainments: and occasionally the members of the four societies acted\\r\\nwith so little concert that their festivals, falling at exactly the same\\r\\ntime, were productive of rivalry and disappointments. Dugdale thinks\\r\\nthat the Christmas revels were not regularly kept in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\nduring the reign of Henry VIII.; and draws attention to an order made by\\r\\nthe benchers of that house on 27 Nov., 22 H. VIII., the record of which\\r\\nruns thus:--\"It is agreed that IF the two Temples do kepe Chrystemas,\\r\\nthen the Chrystemas to be kept here; and to know this, the Steward of\\r\\nthe House ys commanded to get knowledge, and to advertise my masters by\\r\\nthe next day at night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut notwithstanding changes and novelties, the main features of a revel\\r\\nin an Inn of Court were always much the same. Some member of the society\\r\\nconspicuous for rank or wit of style, or for a combination of these\\r\\nqualities, was elected King of the Revel, and until the close of the\\r\\nlong frolic he was despot and sole master of the position--so long as he\\r\\ndid not disregard a few not vexatious conditions by which, the benchers\\r\\nlimited his authority. He surrounded himself with a mock court, exacted\\r\\nhomage from barristers and students, made proclamations to his loyal\\r\\nchildren, sat on a throne at daily banquets, and never appeared in\\r\\npublic without a body-guard, and a numerous company of musicians, to\\r\\nprotect his person and delight his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wit and accomplishments of the younger lawyers were signally\\r\\ndisplayed in the dramatic interludes that usually enlivened these\\r\\nsomewhat heavy and sluggish jollifications. Not only did they write the\\r\\npieces, and put them before the audience with cunning devices for the\\r\\nproduction of scenic effect, but they were their own actors. It was not\\r\\nlong before their \\'moralities\\' were seasoned with political sentiments\\r\\nand allusions to public affairs. For instance, when Wolsey was in the\\r\\nfulness of his power, Sergeant Roo ventured to satirize the Cardinal in\\r\\na masque with which Gray\\'s Inn entertained Henry VIII. and his\\r\\ncourtiers. Hall records that, \"This plaie was so set furth with riche\\r\\nand costlie apparel; with strange diuises of maskes and morrishes, that\\r\\nit was highly praised of all menne saving the Cardinall, whiche imagined\\r\\nthat the plaie had been deuised of him, and in greate furie sent for the\\r\\nsaid Maister Roo, and toke from hym his coife, and sent him to the\\r\\nFlete, and after he sent for the yoong gentlemen that plaied in the\\r\\nplaie, and them highly rebuked and threatened, and sent one of them,\\r\\ncalled Thomas Moyle, of Kent, to the Flete; but by means of friendes\\r\\nMaster Roo and he wer deliuered at last.\" The author stoutly denied that\\r\\nhe intended to satirize the Cardinal; and the chronicler, believing the\\r\\nsergeant\\'s assertions, observes, \"This plaie sore displeased the\\r\\nCardinal, and yet it was never meant to him.\" That the presentation of\\r\\nplays was a usual feature of the festivals at Gray\\'s Inn may be inferred\\r\\nfrom the passage where Dugdale, in his notes on that society, says;--\"In\\r\\n4 Edw. VI. (17 Nov.), it was also ordered that henceforth there should\\r\\nbe no comedies called _Interludes_ in this House out of Term time, but\\r\\nwhen the feast of the Nativity of our Lord is solemnly observed. And\\r\\nthat when there shall be any such comedies, then all the society at that\\r\\ntime in commons to bear the charge of the apparel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding her anxiety for the maintenance of good discipline in\\r\\nthe Inns of Court, Queen Elizabeth encouraged the Societies to celebrate\\r\\ntheir feasts with costliness and liberal hospitality, and her taste for\\r\\ndramatic entertainments increased the splendor and frequency of\\r\\ntheatrical diversions amongst the lawyers. Christopher Hatton\\'s name is\\r\\nconnected with the history of the English drama, by the acts which he\\r\\ncontributed to \\'The Tragedie of Tancred and Gismunda, compiled by the\\r\\ngentlemen of the Inner Temple, and by them presented before her\\r\\nmajestie;\\' and he was one of the chief actors in that ponderous and\\r\\nextravagant mummery with which the Inner Temple kept Christmas in the\\r\\nfourth year of Elizabeth\\'s reign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe circumstances of that festival merit special notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third year of Elizabeth\\'s reign the Middle Temple and the Inner\\r\\nTemple were at fierce war, the former society having laid claim to\\r\\nLyon\\'s Inn, which had been long regarded as a dependency of the Inner\\r\\nTemple. The two Chief Justices, Sir Robert Catlyn and Sir James Dyer,\\r\\nwere known to think well of the claimant\\'s title, and the masters of the\\r\\nInner Temple bench anticipated an adverse decision, when Lord Robert\\r\\nDudley (afterwards Earl of Leicester) came to their relief with an order\\r\\nfrom Queen Elizabeth enjoining the Middle Templars no longer to vex\\r\\ntheir neighbors in the matter. Submission being the only course open to\\r\\nthem, the lawyers of the Middle Temple desisted from their claim; and\\r\\nthe Masters of the Inner Temple Bench expressed their great gratitude to\\r\\nLord Robert Dudley, \"by ordering and enacting that no person or persons\\r\\nof their society that then were, or thereafter should be, should be\\r\\nretained of councell against him the said Lord Robert, or his heirs; and\\r\\nthat the arms of the said Lord Robert should be set up and placed in\\r\\nsome convenient place in their Hall as a continual monument of his\\r\\nlordship\\'s favor unto them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther honors were paid to this nobleman at the ensuing Christmas, when\\r\\nthe Inner Temple held a revel of unusual magnificence and made Lord\\r\\nRobert the ruler of the riot. Whilst the holidays lasted the young\\r\\nlord\\'s title and style were \"Pallaphilos, prince of Sophie High\\r\\nConstable Marshal of the Knights Templars, and Patron of the Honorable\\r\\nOrder of Pegasus.\" And he kept a stately court, having for his chief\\r\\nofficers--Mr. Onslow (Lord Chancellor), Anthony Stapleton (Lord\\r\\nTreasurer), Robert Kelway (Lord Privy Seal), John Fuller (Chief Justice\\r\\nof the King\\'s Bench), William Pole (Chief Justice of the Common Pleas),\\r\\nRoger Manwood (Chief Baron of the Exchequer), Mr. Bashe (Steward of the\\r\\nHousehold), Mr. Copley (Marshal of the Household), Mr. Paten (Chief\\r\\nButler), Christopher Hatton (Master of the Game), Messieurs Blaston,\\r\\nYorke, Penston, Jervise (Masters of the Revels), Mr. Parker (Lieutenant\\r\\nof the Tower), Mr. Kendall (Carver), Mr. Martyn (Ranger of the Forests),\\r\\nand Mr. Stradling (Sewer). Besides these eighteen Placemen, Pallaphilos\\r\\nhad many other mock officers, whose names are not recorded, and he was\\r\\nattended by a body-guard of fourscore members of the Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the pages of Gerard Leigh and Dugdale, the reader can obtain a\\r\\nsufficiently minute account of the pompous ceremonials and heavy\\r\\nbuffooneries of the season. He may learn some of the special services\\r\\nand contributions which Prince Pallaphilos required of his chief\\r\\ncourtiers, and take note how Mr. Paten, as Chief Butler, had to provide\\r\\nseven dozen silver and gilt spoons, twelve dozen silver and gilt\\r\\nsalt-cellars, twenty silver and gilt candlesticks, twenty fine large\\r\\ntable-cloths of damask and diaper, twenty dozen white napkins, three\\r\\ndozen fair large towels, twenty dozen white cups and green pots, to say\\r\\nnothing of carving-knives, carving table, tureens, bread, beer, ale, and\\r\\nwine. The reader also may learn from those chroniclers how the company\\r\\nwere placed according to degrees at different tables; how the banquets\\r\\nwere served to the sound of drums and fifes; how the boar\\'s head was\\r\\nbrought in upon a silver dish; how the gentlemen in gowns, the\\r\\ntrumpeters, and other musicians followed the boar\\'s head in stately\\r\\nprocession; and how, by a rule somewhat at variance with modern notions\\r\\nconcerning old English hospitality, strangers of worth were expected to\\r\\npay in cash for their entertainment, eightpence per head being the\\r\\ncharge for dinner on the day of Christmas Eve, and twelve-pence being\\r\\ndemanded from each stranger for his dinner on the following day.\\r\\n\\r\\nLadies were not excluded from all the festivities; though it may be\\r\\npresumed they did not share in all the riotous meals of the period. It\\r\\nis certain that they were invited, together with the young law-students\\r\\nfrom the Inns of Chancery, to see a play and a masque acted in the hall;\\r\\nthat seats were provided for their special accommodation in the hall\\r\\nwhilst the sports were going forward; and that at the close of the\\r\\ndramatic performances the gallant dames and pretty girls were\\r\\nentertained by Pallaphilos in the library with a suitable banquet;\\r\\nwhilst the mock Lord Chancellor, Mr. Onslow, presided at a feast in the\\r\\nhall, which with all possible speed had been converted from theatrical\\r\\nto more appropriate uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though the fun was rare and the array was splendid to idle folk of\\r\\nthe sixteenth century, modern taste would deem such gaiety rude and\\r\\nwearisome, would call the ladies\\' banquet a disorderly scramble, and\\r\\nthink the whole frolic scarce fit for schoolboys. And in many respects\\r\\nthose revels of olden time were indecorous, noisy, comfortless affairs.\\r\\nThere must have been a sad want of room and fresh air in the Inner\\r\\nTemple dining-hall, when all the members of the inn, the selected\\r\\nstudents from the subordinate Inns of Chancery, and half a hundred\\r\\nladies (to say nothing of Mr. Gerard Leigh and illustrious strangers),\\r\\nhad crowded into the space set apart for the audience. At the dinners\\r\\nwhat wrangling and tumult must have arisen through squabbles for place,\\r\\nand the thousand mishaps that always attend an endeavor to entertain\\r\\nfive hundred gentlemen at a dinner, in a room barely capacious enough\\r\\nfor the proper accommodation of a hundred and fifty persons. Unless this\\r\\nwriter greatly errs, spoons and knives were in great request, and table\\r\\nlinen was by no means \\'fair and spotless\\' towards the close of the rout.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuperb, on that holyday, was the aspect of Prince Pallaphilos. Wearing a\\r\\ncomplete suit of elaborately wrought and richly gilt armor, he bore\\r\\nabove his helmet a cloud of curiously dyed feathers, and held a gilt\\r\\npole-axe in his hand. By his side walked the Lieutenant of the Tower\\r\\n(Mr. Parker), clad in white armor, and like Pallaphilos furnished with\\r\\nfeathers and a pole-axe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn entering the hall the prince and his Lieutenant of the Tower were\\r\\npreceded by sixteen trumpeters (at full blare), four drummers (at full\\r\\ndrum), and a company of fifers (at full whistle), and followed by four\\r\\nmen in white armor, bearing halberds in their hands. Thrice did this\\r\\nprocession march round the fire that blazed in the centre of the hall;\\r\\nand when in the course of these three circuits the four halberdiers and\\r\\nthe musicians had trodden upon everybody\\'s toes (their own included),\\r\\nand when moreover they had blown themselves out of time and breath,\\r\\nsilence was proclaimed; and Prince Pallaphilos, having laid aside his\\r\\npole-axe and his naked sword and a few other trifles, took his seat at\\r\\nthe urgent entreaty of the mock Lord Chancellor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Kit Hatton\\'s appearance and part in the proceedings were even more\\r\\noutrageously ridiculous. The future Lord Chancellor of England was then\\r\\na very elegant and witty young fellow, proud of his quick humor and\\r\\nhandsome face, but far prouder of his exquisitely proportioned legs. No\\r\\nsooner had Prince Pallaphilos taken his seat, at the Lord Chancellor\\'s\\r\\nsuggestion, than Kit Hatton (as master of the game) entered the hall,\\r\\ndressed in a complete suit of green velvet, and holding a green bow in\\r\\nhis left hand. His quiver was supplied with green arrows, and round his\\r\\nneck was slung a hunting-horn. By Kit\\'s side, arrayed in exactly the\\r\\nsame style, walked the Ranger of the Forests (Mr. Martyn); and having\\r\\nforced their way into the crowded chamber, the two young men blew three\\r\\nblasts of venery upon their horns, and then paced three times round the\\r\\nfire. After thus parading the hall they paused before the Lord\\r\\nChancellor, to whom the Master of Game made three curtsies, and then on\\r\\nhis knees proclaimed the desire of his heart to serve the mighty Prince\\r\\nPallaphilos.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving risen from his kneeling posture Kit Hatton blew his horn, and at\\r\\nthe signal his huntsman entered the room, bringing with him a fox, a\\r\\ncat, and ten couples of hounds. Forthwith the fox was released from the\\r\\npole to which it was bound; and when the luckless creature had crept\\r\\ninto a corner under one of the tables, the ten couples of hounds were\\r\\nsent in pursuit. It is a fact that English gentlemen in the sixteenth\\r\\ncentury thus amused themselves with a fox-hunt in a densely crowded\\r\\ndining-room. Over tables and under tables, up the hall and down the\\r\\nhall, those score hounds went at full cry after a miserable fox, which\\r\\nthey eventually ran into and killed in the cinder-pit, or as Dugdale\\r\\nexpresses it, \"beneath the fire.\" That work achieved, the cat was turned\\r\\noff, and the hounds sent after her, with much blowing of horns, much\\r\\ncracking of whips, and deafening cries of excitement from the gownsmen,\\r\\nwho tumbled over one another in their eagerness to be in at the death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RIVER AND THE STRAND BY TORCHLIGHT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely less out of place in the dining-hall than Kit Hatton\\'s hounds,\\r\\nwas the mule fairly mounted on which the Prince Pallaphilos made his\\r\\nappearance at the High Table after supper, when he notified to his\\r\\nsubjects in what manner they were to disport themselves till bedtime.\\r\\nThus also when the Prince of Purpoole kept his court at Gray\\'s Inn, A.D.\\r\\n1594, the prince\\'s champion rode into the dining-hall upon the back of a\\r\\nfiery charger which, like the rider, was clothed in a panoply of steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn costliness and riotous excess the Prince of Purpoole\\'s revel at\\r\\nGray\\'s Inn was not inferior to any similar festivity in the time of\\r\\nElizabeth. On the 20th of December, St. Thomas\\'s Eve, the Prince (one\\r\\nMaster Henry Holmes, a Norfolk gentleman) took up his quarters in the\\r\\nGreat Hall of the Inn, and by the 3rd day of January the grandeur and\\r\\ncomicality of his proceedings had created so much talk throughout the\\r\\ntown that the Lord Treasurer Burghley, the Earls of Cumberland, Essex,\\r\\nShrewsbury and Westmoreland, the Lords Buckhurst, Windsor, Sheffield,\\r\\nCompton, and a magnificent array of knights and ladies visited Gray\\'s\\r\\nInn Hall on that day and saw the masque which the revellers put upon the\\r\\nstage. After the masque there was a banquet, which was followed by a\\r\\nball. On the following day the prince, attended by eighty gentlemen of\\r\\nGray\\'s Inn and the Temple (each of the eighty wearing a plume on his\\r\\nhead), dined in state with the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the city, at\\r\\nCrosby Place. The frolic continued for many days more; the royal\\r\\nPurpoole on one occasion visiting Blackwall with a splendid retinue, on\\r\\nanother (Twelfth Night) receiving a gallant assembly of lords, ladies,\\r\\nand Knights, at his court in Gray\\'s Inn, and on a third (Shrovetide)\\r\\nvisiting the queen herself at Greenwich, when Her Majesty warmly\\r\\napplauded the masque set before her by the actors who were members of\\r\\nthe Prince\\'s court. So delighted was Elizabeth with the entertainment,\\r\\nthat she graciously allowed the masquers to kiss her right hand, and\\r\\nloudly extolled Gray\\'s Inn \"as an house she was much indebted to, for it\\r\\ndid always study for some sports to present unto her;\" whilst to the\\r\\nmock Prince she showed her favor, by placing in his hand the jewel (set\\r\\nwith seventeen diamonds and fourteen rubies) which he had won by valor\\r\\nand skill in the tournament which formed part of the Shrovetide sports.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous entries in the records of the inns testify to the importance\\r\\nassigned by the olden lawyers to their periodic feasts; and though in\\r\\nthe fluctuations of public opinion with regard to the effects of\\r\\ndramatic amusements, certain benchers, or even all the benchers of a\\r\\nparticular inn, may be found at times discountenancing the custom of\\r\\npresenting masques, the revels were usually diversified and heightened\\r\\nby stage plays. Not only were interludes given at the high and grand\\r\\nholidays styled _Solemn Revels_, but also at the minor festivities\\r\\ntermed Post Revels they were usually had recourse to for amusement.\\r\\n\"Besides those _solemn revels_, or measures aforesaid,\" says Dugdale,\\r\\nconcerning the old usages of the \\'Middle Temple,\\' \"they had wont to be\\r\\nentertained with Post Revels performed by the better sort of the young\\r\\ngentlemen of the society, with galliards, corrantoes, and other dances,\\r\\nor else with stage-plays; the first of these feasts being at the\\r\\nbeginning, and the other at the latter end of Christmas. But of late\\r\\nyears these Post Revels have been disused, both here and in the other\\r\\nInns of Court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides producing and acting some of our best Pro-Shakespearian dramas,\\r\\nthe Elizabethan lawyers put upon the stage at least one of William\\r\\nShakespeare\\'s plays. From the diary of a barrister (supposed to be John\\r\\nManningham, of the Middle Temple), it is learnt that the Middle\\r\\nTemplar\\'s acted Shakespeare\\'s \\'Twelfth Night\\' at the Readers\\' feast on\\r\\nCandlemas Day, 1601-2.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following reign, the masques of the lawyers in no degree fell off\\r\\nwith regard to splendor. Seldom had the Thames presented a more\\r\\npicturesque and exhilarating spectacle than it did on the evening of\\r\\nFebruary 20, 1612, when the gentlemen masquers of Gray\\'s Inn and the\\r\\nTemple, entered the king\\'s royal barge at Winchester House, at seven\\r\\no\\'clock, and made the voyage to Whitehall, attended by hundreds of\\r\\nbarges and boats, each vessel being so brilliantly illuminated that the\\r\\nlights reflected upon the ripples of the river, seemed to be countless.\\r\\nAs though the hum and huzzas of the vast multitude on the water were\\r\\ninsufficient to announce the approach of the dazzling pageant, guns\\r\\nmarked the progress of the revellers, and as they drew near the palace,\\r\\nall the attendant bands of musicians played the same stirring tune with\\r\\nuniform time. It is on record that the king received the amateur actors\\r\\nwith an excess of condescension, and was delighted with the masque which\\r\\nMaster Beaumont of the Inner Temple, and his friend, Master Fletcher,\\r\\nhad written and dedicated \"to the worthy Sir Francis Bacon, his\\r\\nMajesty\\'s Solicitor-General, and the grave and learned bench of the\\r\\nanciently-called houses of Grayes Inn and the Inner Temple, and the\\r\\nInner Temple and Grayes Inn.\" The cost of this entertainment was\\r\\ndefrayed by the members of the two inns--each reader paying £4, each\\r\\nancient, £2 10_s._; each barrister, £2, and each student, 20_s._\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inner Temple and Gray\\'s Inn having thus testified their loyalty and\\r\\ndramatic taste, in the following year on Shrove-Monday night (Feb. 15,\\r\\n1613), Lincoln\\'s Inn and the Middle Temple, with no less splendor and\\r\\n_éclat_, enacted at Whitehall a masque written by George Chapman. For\\r\\nthis entertainment, Inigo Jones designed and perfected the theatrical\\r\\ndecorations in a style worthy of an exhibition that formed part of the\\r\\ngaieties with which the marriage of the Palsgrave with the Princess\\r\\nElizabeth was celebrated. And though the masquers went to Whitehall by\\r\\nland, their progress was not less pompous than the procession which had\\r\\npassed up the Thames in the February of the preceding year. Having\\r\\nmustered in Chancery Lane, at the official residence of the Master of\\r\\nthe Rolls, the actors and their friends delighted the town with a\\r\\ngallant spectacle. Mounted on richly-caparisoned and mettlesome horses,\\r\\nthey rode from Fleet Street up the Strand, and by Charing Cross to\\r\\nWhitehall, through a tempest of enthusiasm. Every house was illuminated,\\r\\nevery window was crowded with faces, on every roof men stood in rows,\\r\\nfrom every balcony bright eyes looked down upon the gay scene, and from\\r\\nbasement to garret, from kennel to roof-top throughout the long way,\\r\\ndeafening cheers testified, whilst they increased the delight of the\\r\\nmultitude. Such a pageant would, even in these sober days, rouse London\\r\\nfrom her cold propriety. Having thrown aside his academic robe, each\\r\\nmasquer had donned a fantastic dress of silver cloth embroidered with\\r\\ngold lace, gold plate, and ostrich plumes. He wore across his breast a\\r\\ngold baldrick, round his neck a ruff of white feathers brightened with\\r\\npearls and silver lace, and on his head a coronal of snowy plumes.\\r\\nBefore each mounted masquer rode a torch-bearer, whose right hand waved\\r\\na scourge of flame, instead of a leathern thong. In a gorgeous chariot,\\r\\npreceded by a long train of heralds, were exhibited the Dramatis\\r\\nPersonæ--Honor, Plutus, Eunomia, Phemeis, Capriccio--arrayed in their\\r\\nappointed costumes; and it was rumored that the golden canopy of their\\r\\ncoach had been bought for an enormous sum. Two other triumphal cars\\r\\nconveyed the twelve chief musicians of the kingdom, and these masters of\\r\\nmelody were guarded by torch-bearers, marching two deep before and\\r\\nbehind, and on either side of the glittering carriages. Preceding the\\r\\nmusicians, rode a troop of ludicrous objects, who roused the derision of\\r\\nthe mob, and made fat burghers laugh till tears ran down their cheeks.\\r\\nThey were the mock masque, each resembling an ape, each wearing a\\r\\nfantastic dress that heightened the hideous absurdity of his monkey\\'s\\r\\nvisage, each riding upon an ass, or small pony, and each of them\\r\\nthrowing shells upon the crowd by way of a largess. In the front of the\\r\\nmock masque, forming the vanguard of the entire spectacle, rode fifty\\r\\ngentlemen of the Inns of Court, reining high-bred horses, and followed\\r\\nby their running footmen, whose liveries added to the gorgeous\\r\\nmagnificence of the display.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the expenses which fell upon individuals taking part in the\\r\\nplay, or procession, this entertainment cost the two inns £1086 8_s._\\r\\n11_d._ About the same time Gray\\'s Inn, at the instigation of Attorney\\r\\nGeneral Sir Francis Bacon, performed \\'The Masque of Flowers\\' before the\\r\\nlords and ladies of the court, in the Banqueting-house, Whitehall; and\\r\\nsix years later Thomas Middleton\\'s Inner Temple Masque, or Masque of\\r\\nHeroes\\' was presented before a goodly company of grand ladies by the\\r\\nInner Templars.\\r\\n\\r\\n[20] The propensity of lawyers for the stage, lingered amongst\\r\\nbarristers on Circuit, to a comparatively recent date. \\'Old stagers\\' of\\r\\nthe Home and Western Circuits, can recall how the juniors of their\\r\\nbriefless and bagless days used to entertain the natives of Guildford\\r\\nand Exeter with Shakspearian performances. The Northern Circuit also was\\r\\nat one time famous for the histrionic ability of its bar, but toward the\\r\\nclose of the last century, the dramatic recreations of its junior\\r\\nmembers were discountenanced by the Grand Court.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-PRYNNE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the masques mentioned in the records of the Inns of Court, the\\r\\nmost magnificent and costly was the famous Anti-Prynne demonstration, by\\r\\nwhich the lawyers endeavored to show their contemptuous disapproval of a\\r\\nwork that inveighed against the licentiousness of the stage, and\\r\\npreferred a charge of wanton levity against those who encouraged\\r\\ntheatrical performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the \\'Histriomastix\\' rendered the author ridiculous to mere men of\\r\\npleasure, it roused fierce animosities by the truth and fearless\\r\\ncompleteness of its assertions; but to no order of society was the\\r\\nfamous attack on the stage more offensive than to the lawyers; and of\\r\\nlawyers the members of Lincoln\\'s Inn were the most vehement in their\\r\\ndispleasure. The actors writhed under the attack; the lawyers were\\r\\nliterally furious with rage--for whilst rating them soundly for their\\r\\nlove of theatrical amusements, Prynne almost contrived to make it seem\\r\\nthat his views were acceptable to the wisest and most reverend members\\r\\nof the legal profession. Himself a barrister of Lincoln\\'s Inn, he with\\r\\nequal craft and audacity complimented the benchers of that society on\\r\\nthe firmness with which they had forbidden professional actors to take\\r\\npart in the periodic revels of the inn, and on their inclination to\\r\\ngovern the society in accordance with Puritanical principles. Addressing\\r\\nhis \"Much Honored Friends, the Right Worshipful Masters of the Bench of\\r\\nthe Honorable Flourishing Law Society of Lincoln\\'s Inne,\" the\\r\\nutter-barrister said: \"For whereas other Innes of Court (I know not by\\r\\nwhat evil custom, and worse example) admit of common actors and\\r\\ninterludes upon their two grand festivalls, to recreate themselves\\r\\nwithall, notwithstanding the statutes of our Kingdome (of which\\r\\nlawyers, of all others, should be most observant), have branded all\\r\\nprofessed stage-players for infamous rogues, and stage-playes for\\r\\nunlawful pastimes, especially on Lord\\'s-dayes and other solemn\\r\\nholidayes, on which these grand dayes ever fall; yet such hath been your\\r\\npious tender care, not only of this societie\\'s honor, but also of the\\r\\nyoung students\\' good (for the advancing of whose piety and studies you\\r\\nhave of late erected a magnificent chapel, and since that a library),\\r\\nthat as you have prohibited by late publicke orders, all disorderly\\r\\nBacchanalian Grand-Christmasses (more fit for pagans than Christians;\\r\\nfor the deboisest roarers than grave civill students, who should be\\r\\npatternes of sobriety unto others), together with all publicke dice-play\\r\\nin the Hall (a most pernicious, infamous game; condemned in all ages,\\r\\nall places, not onely by councels, fathers, divines, civilians,\\r\\ncanonists, politicians, and other Christian writers; by divers Pagan\\r\\nauthors of all sorts, and by Mahomet himselfe; but likewise by sundry\\r\\nheathen, yea, Christian Magistrates\\' edicts).\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the London theatres he observes that the \"two old play\\r\\nhouses\" (_i.e._, the Fortune and the Red Bull), the \"new theatre\"\\r\\n(_i.e._, Whitefriars play-house), and two other established theatres,\\r\\nbeing found inadequate to the wants of the play-going public, a sixth\\r\\ntheatre had recently been opened. \"The multitude of our London\\r\\nplay-haunters being so augmented now, that all the ancient Divvel\\'s\\r\\nChappels (for so the fathers style all play-houses) being five in\\r\\nnumber, are not sufficient to containe their troops, whence we see a\\r\\nsixth now added to them, whereas even in vitious Nero his raigne there\\r\\nwere but three standing theatres in Pagan Rome (though far more splendid\\r\\nthan Christian London), and those three too many.\" Having thus\\r\\nenumerated some of the saddest features of his age, the author of the\\r\\n\\'Player\\'s Scourge\\' again commends the piety and decorum of the\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Benchers, saying, \"So likewise in imitation of the ancient\\r\\nLacedæmonians and Massilienses, or rather of primitive zealous\\r\\nChristians, you have always from my first admission into your society,\\r\\nand long before, excluded all common players with their ungodly\\r\\ninterludes, from all your solemn festivals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the benchers of one Inn winced under Prynne\\'s \\'expressions of\\r\\napproval,\\' the students of all the Inns of Court were even more\\r\\ndispleased with the author who, in a dedicatory letter \"to the right\\r\\nChristian, Generous Young Gentlemen-Students of the four Innes of Court,\\r\\nand especially those of Lincolne\\'s Inne,\" urged them to \"at last\\r\\nfalsifie that ignominious censure which some English writers in their\\r\\nprinted works have passed upon Innes of Court Students, of whom they\\r\\nrecord:--That Innes of Court men were undone but for players, that they\\r\\nare their chiefest guests and imployment, and the sole business that\\r\\nmakes them afternoon\\'s men; that is one of the first things they learne\\r\\nas soon as they are admitted, to see stage-playes, and take smoke at a\\r\\nplay-house, which they commonly make their studie; where they quickly\\r\\nlearne to follow all fashions, to drinke all healths, to wear favours\\r\\nand good cloathes, to consort with ruffianly companions, to swear the\\r\\nbiggest oaths, to quarrel easily, fight desperately, quarrel\\r\\ninordinately, to spend their patrimony ere it fall, to use gracefully\\r\\nsome gestures of apish compliment, to talk irreligiously, to dally with\\r\\na mistresse, and hunt after harlots, to prove altogether lawless in\\r\\nsteed of lawyers, and to forget that little learning, grace, and vertue\\r\\nwhich they had before; so much that they grow at last past hopes of ever\\r\\ndoing good, either to the church, their country, their owne or others\\'\\r\\nsouls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storm of indignation which followed the appearance of the\\r\\n\\'Histriomastix\\' was directed by the members of the Four Inns, who felt\\r\\nthemselves bound by honor no less than by interest, to disavow all\\r\\nconnexion with, or leaning towards, the unpopular author.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the suggestion of Lincoln\\'s Inn, the four societies combined their\\r\\nforces, and at a cost of more than twenty thousand pounds, in addition\\r\\nto sums spent by individuals, entertained the Court with that splendid\\r\\nmasque which Whitelock has described in his \\'Memoirs\\' with elaborate\\r\\nprolixity. The piece entitled \\'The Triumph of Peace,\\' was written by\\r\\nShirley, and it was produced with a pomp and lavish expenditure that\\r\\nwere without precedent. The organization and guidance of the undertaking\\r\\nwere entrusted to a committee of eight barristers, two from each inn;\\r\\nand this select body comprised men who were alike remarkable for\\r\\ntalents, accomplishments, and ambition, and some of whom were destined\\r\\nto play strangely diverse parts in the drama of their epoch. It\\r\\ncomprised Edward Hyde, then in his twenty-sixth year; young Bulstrode\\r\\nWhitelock, who had not yet astonished the more decorous magnates of his\\r\\ncountry by wearing a falling-band at the Oxford Quarter Sessions; Edward\\r\\nHerbert, the most unfortunate of Cavalier lawyers; John Selden, already\\r\\na middle-aged man; John Finch, born in the same year as Selden, and\\r\\nalready far advanced in his eager course to a not honorable notoriety.\\r\\nAttorney General Noy was also of the party, but his disastrous career\\r\\nwas already near its close.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe committee of management had their quarters at Ely House, Holborn;\\r\\nand from that historic palace the masquers started for Whitehall on the\\r\\neve of Candlemas Day, 1633-4. It was a superb procession. First marched\\r\\ntwenty tall footmen, blazing in liveries of scarlet cloth trimmed with\\r\\nlace, each of them holding a baton in his right hand, and in his left a\\r\\nflaring torch that covered his face with light, and made the steel and\\r\\nsilver of his sword-scabbard shine brilliantly. A company of the\\r\\nmarshal\\'s men marched next with firm and even steps, clearing the way\\r\\nfor their master. A burst of deafening applause came from the multitude\\r\\nas the marshal rode through the gateway of Ely House, and caracoled over\\r\\nthe Holborn way on the finest charger that the king\\'s stables could\\r\\nfurnish. A perfect horseman and the handsomest man then in town, Mr.\\r\\nDarrel of Lincoln\\'s Inn, had been elected to the office of marshal in\\r\\ndeference to his wealth, his noble aspect, his fine nature, and his\\r\\nperfect mastery of all manly sports. On either side of Mr. Darrel\\'s\\r\\nhorse marched a lacquey bearing a flambeau, and the marshal\\'s page was\\r\\nin attendance with his master\\'s cloak. An interval of some twenty paces,\\r\\nand then came the marshal\\'s body-guard, composed of one hundred mounted\\r\\ngentlemen of the Inns of Court--twenty-five from each house; showing in\\r\\ntheir faces the signs of gentle birth and honorable nurture; and with\\r\\nstrong hands reining mettlesome chargers that had been furnished for\\r\\ntheir use by the greatest nobles of the land. This flood of flashing\\r\\nchivalry was succeeded by an anti-masque of beggars and cripples,\\r\\nmounted on the lamest and most unsightly of rat-tailed srews and\\r\\nspavined ponies, and wearing dresses that threw derision on legal\\r\\nvestments and decorations. Another anti-masque satirized the wild\\r\\nprojects of crazy speculators and inventors; and as it moved along the\\r\\nspectators laughed aloud at the \"fish-call, or looking-glass for fishes\\r\\nin the sea, very useful for fishermen to call all kinds of fish to their\\r\\nnets;\" the newly-invented wind-mate for raising a breeze over becalmed\\r\\nseas, the \"movable hydraulic\" which should give sleep to patients\\r\\nsuffering under fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nChariots and horsemen, torch-bearers and lacqueys, followed in order.\\r\\n\"Then came the first chariot of the grand masquers, which was not so\\r\\nlarge as those that went before, but most curiously framed, carved, and\\r\\npainted with exquisite art, and purposely for this service and occasion.\\r\\nThe form of it was after that of the Roman triumphant chariots. The\\r\\nseats in it were made of oval form in the back end of the chariot, so\\r\\nthat there was no precedence in them, and the faces of all that sat in\\r\\nit might be seen together. The colors of the first chariot were silver\\r\\nand crimson, given by the lot to Gray\\'s Inn: the chariot was drawn with\\r\\nfour horses all abreast, and they were covered to their heels all over\\r\\nwith cloth of tissue, of the colors of crimson and silver, huge plumes\\r\\nof white and red feathers on their heads; the coachman\\'s cap and\\r\\nfeather, his long coat, and his very whip and cushion of the same stuff\\r\\nand color. In this chariot sat the four grand masquers of Gray\\'s Inn,\\r\\ntheir habits, doublets, trunk-hose, and caps of most rich cloth of\\r\\ntissue, and wrought as thick with silver spangles as they could be\\r\\nplaced; large white stockings up to their trunk-hose, and rich sprigs in\\r\\ntheir cap, themselves proper and beautiful young gentlemen. On each side\\r\\nof the chariot were four footmen in liveries of the color of the\\r\\nchariot, carrying huge flamboys in their hands, which, with the torches,\\r\\ngave such a lustre to the paintings, spangles, and habits that hardly\\r\\nanything could be invented to appear more glorious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSix musicians followed the state-chariot of Gray\\'s Inn, playing as they\\r\\nwent; and then came the triumphal cars of the Middle Templars, the Inner\\r\\nTemplars, and the Lincoln\\'s Inn men--each car being drawn by four horses\\r\\nand attended by torch-bearers, flambeau-bearers, and musicians. In shape\\r\\nthese four cars were alike, but they differed in the color of their\\r\\nfittings. Whilst Gray\\'s Inn used scarlet and silver, the Middle\\r\\nTemplars chose blue and silver decorations, and each of the other two\\r\\nhouses adopted a distinctive color for the housings of their horses and\\r\\nthe liveries of their servants. It is noteworthy that the inns (equal as\\r\\nto considerations of dignity) took their places in the pageant by lot;\\r\\nand that the four grand masquers of each inn were seated in their\\r\\nchariot on seats so constructed that none of the four took precedence of\\r\\nthe others. The inns, in days when questions of precedence received much\\r\\nattention, were very particular in asserting their equality, whenever\\r\\ntwo or more of them acted in co-operation. To mark this equality, the\\r\\nmasque written by Beaumont and Fletcher in 1612 was described \"The\\r\\nMasque of the Inner Temple and Grayes Inn; Grayes Inn and the Inner\\r\\nTemple:\" and the dedication of the piece to Francis Bacon, reversing\\r\\nthis transposition, mentions \"the allied houses of Grayes Inn and the\\r\\nInner Temple, and the Inner Temple and Grayes Inn,\" these changes being\\r\\nmade to point the equal rank of the two fraternities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the illuminated streets this pageant marched to the sound of\\r\\ntrumpets and drums, cymbals and fifes, amidst the deafening acclamations\\r\\nof the delighted town; and when the lawyers reached Whitehall, the king\\r\\nand queen were so delighted with the spectacle, that the procession was\\r\\nordered to make the circuit of the tilt-yard for the gratification of\\r\\ntheir Majesties, who would fain see the sight once again from the\\r\\nwindows of their palace. Is there need to speak of the manner in which\\r\\nthe masque was acted, of the music and dances, of the properties and\\r\\nscenes, of the stately banquet after the play and the grand ball which\\r\\nbegan at a still later hour, of the king\\'s urbanity and the graciousness\\r\\nof Henrietta, who \"did the honor to some of the masquers to dance with\\r\\nthem herself, and to judge them as good dancers as she ever saw!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding a few untoward broils and accidents, the entertainment\\r\\npassed off so satisfactorily that \\'The Triumph of Peace\\' was acted for a\\r\\nsecond time in the presence of the king and queen, in the Merchant\\r\\nTaylors\\' Hall. Other diversions of the same kind followed with scarcely\\r\\nless _éclat_. At Whitehall the king himself and some of the choicest\\r\\nnobles of the land turned actors, and performed a grand masque, on which\\r\\noccasion the Templars were present as spectators in seats of honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Shrovetide rejoicings of 1635, Henrietta even condescended to\\r\\nwitness the performance of Davenant\\'s \\'Triumphs of the Prince d\\'Amour,\\'\\r\\nin the hall of the Middle Temple. Laying aside the garb of royalty, she\\r\\nwent to the Temple, attended by a party of lords and ladies, and fine\\r\\ngentlemen who, like herself, assumed for the evening dresses suitable to\\r\\npersons of private station. The Marquis of Hamilton, the Countess of\\r\\nDenbigh, the Countess of Holland, and Lady Elizabeth Fielding were her\\r\\ncompanions; whilst the official attendants on her person were the Earl\\r\\nof Holland, Lord Goring, Mr. Percy, and Mr. Jermyn. Led to her place by\\r\\n\"Mrs. Basse, the law-woman,\" Henrietta took a seat upon a scaffold fixed\\r\\nalong the northern side of the hall, and amidst a crush of benchers\\'\\r\\nwives and daughters saw the play and heartily enjoyed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSays Whitelock, at the conclusion of his account of the grand masque\\r\\ngiven by the four inns, \"Thus these dreams past, and these pomps\\r\\nvanished.\" Scarcely had the frolic terminated when death laid a chill\\r\\nhand on the time-serving Noy, who in the consequences of his dishonest\\r\\ncounsels left a cruel legacy to the master and the country whom he alike\\r\\nbetrayed. A few more years--and John Finch, having lost the Great Seal,\\r\\nwas an exile in a foreign land, destined to die in penury, without\\r\\nagain setting foot on his native soil. The graceful Herbert, whose\\r\\nsmooth cheek had flushed with joy at Henrietta\\'s musical courtesies,\\r\\nbecame for a brief day the mock Lord Keeper of Charles II.\\'s mock court\\r\\nat Paris, and then, dishonored and disowned by his capricious master, he\\r\\nlanguished in poverty and disease, until he found an obscure grave in\\r\\nthe French capital. More fortunate than his early rival, Edward Hyde\\r\\noutlived Charles Stuart\\'s days of adverse fortune, and rose to a\\r\\ngrievous greatness; but like that early rival, he, too, died in exile in\\r\\nFrance. Perhaps of all the managers of the grand masque the scholarly\\r\\npedant, John Selden, had the greatest share of earthly satisfaction. Not\\r\\nthe least fortunate of the party was the historian of \"the pomp and\\r\\nglory, if not the vanity of the show,\" who having survived the\\r\\nCommonwealth and witnessed the Restoration, was permitted to retain his\\r\\npaternal estate, and in his last days could tell his numerous\\r\\ndescendants how his old chum, Edward Hyde, had risen, fallen,\\r\\nand--passed to another world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nAN EMPTY GRATE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the revival of gaiety which attended and followed the Restoration,\\r\\nrevels and masques came once more into vogue at the Inns of Court,\\r\\nwhere, throughout the Commonwealth, plays had been prohibited, and\\r\\nfestivals had been either abolished or deprived of their ancient\\r\\nhilarity. The caterers of amusement for the new king were not slow to\\r\\nsuggest that he should honor the lawyers with a visit; and in accordance\\r\\nwith their counsel, His Majesty took water on August 15, 1661, and went\\r\\nin the royal barge from Whitehall to the Temple to dine at the Reader\\'s\\r\\nfeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeneage Finch had been chosen Autumn Reader of that inn, and in\\r\\naccordance with ancient usage he demonstrated his ability to instruct\\r\\nyoung gentlemen in the principles of English law, by giving a series of\\r\\ncostly banquets. From the days of the Tudors to the rise of Oliver\\r\\nCromwell, the Reader\\'s feasts had been amongst the most sumptuous and\\r\\nostentatious entertainments of the town--the Sergeant\\'s feasts scarcely\\r\\nsurpassing them in splendor, the inaugural dinners of lord mayors often\\r\\nlagging behind them in expense. But Heneage Finch\\'s lavish hospitality\\r\\noutstripped the doings of all previous Readers. His revel was protracted\\r\\nthroughout six days, and on each of these days he received at his table\\r\\nthe representative members of some high social order or learned body.\\r\\nBeginning with a dinner to the nobility and Privy Councillors, he\\r\\nfinished with a banquet to the king; and on the intervening days he\\r\\nentertained the civic authorities, the College of Physicians, the civil\\r\\nlawyers, and the dignitaries of the Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king\\'s visit was attended with imposing ceremony, and wanted no\\r\\ncircumstance that could have rendered the occasion more honorable to the\\r\\nhost or to the society of which he was a member. All the highest\\r\\nofficers of the court accompanied the monarch, and when he stepped from\\r\\nhis barge at the Temple Stairs, he spoke with jovial urbanity to his\\r\\nentertainer and the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who received\\r\\nhim with tokens of loyal deference and attachment. \"On each side,\" says\\r\\nDugdale, \"as His Majesty passed, stood the Reader\\'s servants in scarlet\\r\\ncloaks and white tabba doublets; there being a way made through the wall\\r\\ninto the Temple Gardens; and above them on each side the benchers,\\r\\nbarristers, and other gentlemen of the society, all in their gowns and\\r\\nformalities, the loud music playing from the time of his landing till he\\r\\nentered the hall; where he was received with xx violins, which continued\\r\\nas long as his majesty stayed.\" Fifty chosen gentlemen of the inn,\\r\\nwearing their academic gowns, placed dinner on the table, and waited on\\r\\nthe feasters--no other servants being permitted to enter the hall during\\r\\nthe progress of the banquet. On the dais at the top of the hall, under a\\r\\ncanopy of state, the king and his brother James sat apart from men of\\r\\nlower degree, whilst the nobles of Whitehall occupied one long table,\\r\\nunder the presidency of the Lord Chancellor, and the chief personages of\\r\\nthe inn dined at a corresponding long table, having the reader for their\\r\\nchairman.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following January, Charles II. and the Duke of York honored\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn with a visit, whilst the mock Prince de la Grange held his\\r\\ncourt within the walls of that society. Nine years later--in the\\r\\nFebruary of 1671--King Charles and his brother James again visited\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn, on which occasion they were entertained by Sir Francis\\r\\nGoodericke, Knt., the reader of the inn, who seems almost to have gone\\r\\nbeyond Heneage Finch in sumptuous profusion of hospitality. Of this\\r\\nroyal visit a particular account is to be seen in the Admittance Book of\\r\\nthe Honorable Society, from which it appears that the royal brothers\\r\\nwere attended by the Dukes of Monmouth and Richmond; the Earls of\\r\\nManchester, Bath, and Anglesea; Viscount Halifax, the Bishop of Ely,\\r\\nLord Newport, Lord Henry Howard, and \"divers others of great qualitie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entertainment in most respects was a repetition of Sir Heneage\\r\\nFinch\\'s feast--the king, the Duke of York, and Prince Rupert dining on\\r\\nthe dais at the top of the hall, whilst the persons of inferior though\\r\\nhigh quality were regaled at two long tables, set down the hall; and\\r\\nthe gentlemen of the inn condescending to act as menial servants. The\\r\\nreader himself, dropping on his knee when he performed the servile\\r\\noffice, proffered the towel with which the king prepared himself for the\\r\\nrepast; and barristers of ancient lineage and professional eminence\\r\\ncontended for the honor of serving His Majesty with surloin and\\r\\ncheesecake upon the knee, and hastened with the alacrity of well-trained\\r\\nlacqueys to do the bidding of \"the lords att their table.\" Having eaten\\r\\nand drunk to his lively satisfaction, Charles called for the Admittance\\r\\nBook of the Inn, and placed his name on the roll of members, thereby\\r\\nconferring on the society an honor for which no previous king of England\\r\\nhad furnished a precedent. Following their chief\\'s example, the Duke of\\r\\nYork and Prince Rupert and other nobles forthwith joined the fraternity\\r\\nof lawyers; and hastily donning students\\' gowns, they mingled with the\\r\\ntroop of gowned servitors, and humbly waited on their liege lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn like manner, twenty-one years since (July 29, 1845) when Queen\\r\\nVictoria and her lamented consort visited Lincoln\\'s Inn, on the opening\\r\\nof the new hall, they condescended to enter their names in the Admission\\r\\nBook of the Inn, thereby making themselves students of the society. Her\\r\\nMajesty has not been called to the bar; but Prince Albert in due course\\r\\nbecame a barrister and bencher. Repeating the action of Charles II.\\'s\\r\\ncourtiers, the great Duke of Wellington and the bevy of great nobles\\r\\npresent at the celebration became fellow-students with the queen; and on\\r\\nleaving the table the prince walked down the hall, wearing a student\\'s\\r\\nstuff gown (by no means the most picturesque of academic robes), over\\r\\nhis field-marshal\\'s uniform. Her Majesty forbore to disarrange her\\r\\ntoilet--which consisted of a blue bonnet with blue feathers, a dress of\\r\\nLimerick lace, and a scarlet shawl, with a deep gold edging--by putting\\r\\nher arms through the sleeveless arm-holes of a bombazine frock.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrateful to the lawyers for the cordiality with which they welcomed him\\r\\nto the country, William III. accepted an invitation to the Middle\\r\\nTemple, and was entertained by that society with a banquet and a masque,\\r\\nof which notice has been taken in another chapter of this work; and in\\r\\n1697-8 Peter the Great was a guest at the Christmas revels of the\\r\\nTemplars. On that occasion the Czar enjoyed a favorable opportunity for\\r\\ngratifying his love of strong drink, and for witnessing the ease with\\r\\nwhich our ancestors drank wine by the magnum and punch by the gallon,\\r\\nwhen they were bent on enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the greater refinement and increasing delicacy of the eighteenth\\r\\ncentury, the Inns of Court revels, which had for so many generations\\r\\nbeen conspicuous amongst the gaieties of the town, became less and less\\r\\nmagnificent; and they altogether died out under the second of those\\r\\nGeorges who are thought by some persons to have corrupted public morals\\r\\nand lowered the tastes of society. In 1733-4, when Lord Chancellor\\r\\nTalbot\\'s elevation to the woolsack was celebrated by a revel in the\\r\\nInner Temple Hall, the dulness and disorder of the celebration convinced\\r\\nthe lawyers that they had not acted wisely in attempting to revive\\r\\nusages that had fallen into desuetude because they were inconvenient to\\r\\nnew arrangements or repugnant to modern taste. No attempt was made to\\r\\nprolong the festivity over a succession of days. It was a revel of one\\r\\nday; and no one wished to add another to the period of riot. At two\\r\\no\\'clock on Feb. 2, 1733-4, the new Chancellor, the master of the revels,\\r\\nthe benchers of the inns, and the guests (who were for the most part\\r\\nlawyers), sat down to dinner in the hall. The barristers and students\\r\\nhad their ordinary fare, with the addition of a flask of claret to each\\r\\nmess; but a superior repast was served at the High Table where fourteen\\r\\nstudents (of whom the Chancellor\\'s eldest son was one), served as\\r\\nwaiters. Whilst the banquet was in progress, musicians stationed in the\\r\\ngallery at the upper end of the hall filled the room with deafening\\r\\nnoise, and ladies looked down upon the feasters from a large gallery\\r\\nwhich had been fitted up for their reception over the screen. After\\r\\ndinner, as soon as the hall could be cleared of dishes and decanters,\\r\\nthe company were entertained with \\'Love for Love,\\' and \\'The Devil to\\r\\nPay,\\' performed by professional actors who \"all came from the Haymarket\\r\\nin chairs, ready dressed, and (as it was said), refused any gratuity for\\r\\ntheir trouble, looking upon the honor of distinguishing themselves on\\r\\nthis occasion as sufficient.\" The players having withdrawn, the judges,\\r\\nsergeants, benchers, and other dignitaries, danced \\'round about the coal\\r\\nfire;\\' that is to say, they danced round about a stove in which there\\r\\nwas not a single spark of fire. The congregation of many hundreds of\\r\\npersons, in a hall which had not comfortable room for half the number,\\r\\nrendered the air so oppressively hot that the master of the revels\\r\\nwisely resolved to lead his troop of revellers round an empty grate. The\\r\\nchronicler of this ridiculous mummery observes: \"And all the time of the\\r\\ndance the ancient song, accompanied by music, was sung by one Toby\\r\\nAston, dressed in a bar-gown, whose father had formerly been Master of\\r\\nthe Plea Office in the King\\'s Bench. When this was over, the ladies came\\r\\ndown from the gallery, went into the parliament chamber, and stayed\\r\\nabout a quarter of an hour, while the hall was being put in order. They\\r\\nthen went into the hall and danced a few minuets. Country dances began\\r\\nat ten, and at twelve a Very fine cold collation was provided for the\\r\\nwhole company, from which they returned to dancing, which they\\r\\ncontinued as long as they pleased, and the whole day\\'s entertainment was\\r\\ngenerally thought to be very genteelly and liberally conducted. The\\r\\nPrince of Wales honored the performance with his company part of the\\r\\ntime; he came into the music _incog._ about the middle of the play, and\\r\\nwent away as soon as the farce of \\'walking round the coal fire\\' was\\r\\nover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this notable dance of lawyers round an empty grate, the old revels\\r\\ndisappeared. In their Grand Days, equivalent to the gaudy days, or feast\\r\\ndays, or audit days of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, the Inns of\\r\\nCourt still retain the last vestiges of their ancient jollifications,\\r\\nbut the uproarious riot of the obsolete festivities is but faintly\\r\\nechoed by the songs and laughter of the junior barristers and students\\r\\nwho in these degenerate times gladden their hearts and loosen their\\r\\ntongues with an extra glass of wine after grand dinners, and then hasten\\r\\nback to chambers for tobacco and tea.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the discontinuance of the revels the Inns of Court lost their chief\\r\\nattractions for the courtly pleasure-seekers of the town, and many a day\\r\\npassed before another royal visit was paid to any one of the societies.\\r\\nIn 1734 George III.\\'s father stood amongst the musicians in the Inner\\r\\nTemple Hall; and after the lapse of one century and eleven years the\\r\\npresent queen accepted the hospitality of Lincoln\\'s Inn. No record\\r\\nexists of a royal visit made to an Inn of Court between those events.\\r\\nOnly the other day, however, the Prince of Wales went eastwards and\\r\\npartook of a banquet in the hall of Middle Temple, of which society he\\r\\nis a barrister and a bencher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART VII.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGAL EDUCATION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nINNS OF COURT AND INNS OF CHANCERY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSchools for the study of the Common Law, existed within the bounds of\\r\\nthe city of London, at the commencement of the thirteenth century. No\\r\\nsooner had a permanent home been assigned to the Court of Common Pleas,\\r\\nthan legal practitioners fixed themselves in the neighborhood of\\r\\nWestminster, or within the walls of London. A legal society speedily\\r\\ngrew up in the city; and some of the older and more learned professors\\r\\nof the Common Law, devoting a portion of their time and energies to the\\r\\nlabors of instruction, opened academies for the reception of students.\\r\\nDugdale notices a tradition that in ancient times a law-school, called\\r\\nJohnson\\'s Inn, stood in Dowgate, that another existed in Pewter Lane,\\r\\nand that Paternoster Row contained a third; and it is generally thought\\r\\nthat these three inns were amongst the academies which sprung up as soon\\r\\nas the Common Pleas obtained a permanent abode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schools thus established in the opening years of the thirteenth\\r\\ncentury, were not allowed to flourish for any great length of time; for\\r\\nin the nineteenth year of his reign, Henry III. suppressed them by a\\r\\nmandate addressed to the mayor and sheriffs of the city. But though this\\r\\nking broke up the schools, the scholars persevered in their study; and\\r\\nif the king\\'s mandate aimed at a complete discontinuance of legal\\r\\ninstruction, his policy was signally defeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccessive writers have credited Edward III.\\'s reign with the\\r\\nestablishment of Inns of Court; and it has been erroneously inferred\\r\\nthat the study of the Common Law not only languished, but was altogether\\r\\nextinct during the period of nearly one hundred years that intervened\\r\\nbetween Henry III.\\'s dissolution of the city schools and Edward III.\\'s\\r\\naccession. Abundant evidence, however, exists that this was not the\\r\\ncase. Edward I., in the twentieth year of his reign, ordered his judges\\r\\nof the Common Pleas to \"provide and ordain, from every county, certain\\r\\nattorneys and lawyers\" (in the original \"atturnatus et _apprenticiis_\")\\r\\n\"of the best and most apt for their learning and skill, who might do\\r\\nservice to his court and people; and those so chosen, and no other\\r\\nshould follow his court, and transact affairs therein; the words of\\r\\nwhich order make it clear that the country contained a considerable body\\r\\nof persons who devoted themselves to the study and practice of the law.\"\\r\\nSo also in the Year-book, 1 Ed. III., the words, \"et puis une apprentise\\r\\ndemand,\" show that lawyers holding legal degrees existed in the very\\r\\nfirst year of Edward III.\\'s reign; a fact which justifies the inference\\r\\nthat in the previous reign England contained Common Law schools capable\\r\\nof granting the legal degree of apprentice. Again Dugdale remarks, \"In\\r\\n20 Ed. III., in a _quod ei deforciat_ to an exception taken, it was\\r\\nanswered by Sir Richard de Willoughby (then a learned justice of the\\r\\n_Common Pleas_) and William Skipwith, (afterwards also one of the\\r\\njustices of that court), that the same was no exception amongst the\\r\\n_Apprentices in Hostells or Inns_.\" Whence it is manifest that Inns of\\r\\nCourt were institutions in full vigor at the time when they have been\\r\\nsometimes represented as originally established.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after their expulsion from the city, there is reason to think that\\r\\nthe common lawyers made no attempt to reside in colleges within its\\r\\nboundaries. They preferred to establish themselves on spots where they\\r\\ncould enjoy pure air and rural quietude, could surround themselves with\\r\\ntrees and lawns, or refresh their eyes with the sight of the silver\\r\\nThames. In the earliest part of the fourteenth century, they took\\r\\npossession of a great palace that stood on the western outskirt of the\\r\\ntown, and looked westwards upon green fields, whilst its eastern wall\\r\\nabutted on New Street--a thoroughfare that was subsequently called\\r\\nChancellor\\'s Lane, and has for many years been known as Chancery Lane.\\r\\nThis palace had been the residence of Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, who\\r\\nconferred upon the building the name which it still bears. The earl died\\r\\nin 1310, some seventeen years before Edward III.\\'s accession; and\\r\\nThynne, the antiquary, was of opinion that no considerable period\\r\\nintervened between Henry Lacy\\'s death and the entry of the lawyers. In\\r\\nthe same century, the lawyers took possession of the Temple. The exact\\r\\ndate of their entry is unknown; but Chaucer\\'s verse enables the student\\r\\nto fix, with sufficient preciseness, the period when the more noble\\r\\napprentices of the law first occupied the Temple as tenants of the\\r\\nKnight\\'s Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, who obtained a grant of\\r\\nthe place from Edward III.[21] The absence of fuller particulars\\r\\nconcerning the early history of the legal Templars, is ordinarily and\\r\\nwith good reason attributed to Wat Tyler\\'s rebels, who destroyed the\\r\\nrecords of the fraternity by fire. From roof to basement, beginning with\\r\\nthe tiles, and working downwards, the mob destroyed the principal houses\\r\\nof the college; and when they had burnt all the archives on which they\\r\\ncould lay hands, they went off and expended their remaining fury on\\r\\nother buildings, of which the Knights of St. John were proprietors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same men who saw the lawyers take possession of the Temple on the\\r\\nnorthern banks of the Thames, and of the Earl of Lincoln\\'s palace in New\\r\\nStreet, saw them also make a third grand settlement. The manor of\\r\\nPortepoole, or Purpoole, became the property of the Grays of Wilton, in\\r\\nthe twenty-second year of Edward I.; and on its green fields, lying\\r\\nnorth of Holborn, a society of lawyers established a college which still\\r\\nretains the name of the ancient proprietors of the soil. Concerning the\\r\\nexact date of its institution, the uncertainty is even greater than\\r\\nthat which obscures the foundation of the Temple and Lincoln\\'s Inn; but\\r\\nantiquaries have agreed to assign the creation of Gray\\'s Inn, as an\\r\\nhospicium for the entertainment of lawyers, to the time of Edward III.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date at which the Temple lawyers split up into two separate\\r\\nsocieties, is also unknown; but assigning the division to some period\\r\\nposterior to Wat Tyler\\'s insurrection, Dugdale says, \"But,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, this spoil by the rebels, those students so increased\\r\\nhere, that at length they divided themselves into two bodies; the one\\r\\ncommonly known by the Society of the Inner Temple, and the other of the\\r\\nMiddle Temple, holding this mansion as tenants.\" But as both societies\\r\\nhad a common origin in the migration of lawyers from Thavies Inn,\\r\\nHolborn, in the time of Edward III., it is usual to speak of the two\\r\\nTemples as instituted in that reign, and to regard all four Inns of\\r\\nCourt as the work of the fourteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inns of Chancery for many generations maintained towards the Inns of\\r\\nCourt a position similar to that which Eton School maintains towards\\r\\nKing\\'s at Cambridge, or that which Winchester School holds to New\\r\\nCollege at Oxford. They were seminaries in which lads underwent\\r\\npreparation for the superior discipline and greater freedom of the four\\r\\ncolleges. Each Inn of Court had its own Inns of Chancery, yearly\\r\\nreceiving from them the pupils who had qualified themselves for\\r\\npromotion to the status of Inns-of-Court men. In course of time,\\r\\nstudents after receiving the preliminary education in an Inn of Chancery\\r\\nwere permitted to enter an Inn of Court on which their Inn of Chancery\\r\\nwas not dependent; but at every Inn of Court higher admission fees were\\r\\ncharged to students coming from Inns of Chancery over which it had no\\r\\ncontrol, than to students who came from its own primary schools. If the\\r\\nreader bears in mind the difference in respect to age, learning, and\\r\\nprivileges between our modern public schoolboys and university\\r\\nundergraduates, he will realize with sufficient nearness to truth the\\r\\ndifferences which existed between the Inns of Chancery students and the\\r\\nInns of Court students in the fifteenth century; and in the students,\\r\\nutter-barristers, and benchers of the Inns of Court at the same period\\r\\nhe may see three distinct orders of academic persons closely resembling\\r\\nthe undergraduates, bachelors of arts, and masters of arts in our\\r\\nuniversities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the \\'De Laudibus Legum Angliæ,\\'[22] written in the latter part of the\\r\\nfifteenth century, Sir John Fortescue says--\"But to the intent, most\\r\\nexcellent Prince, yee may conceive a forme and an image of this study,\\r\\nas I am able, I wil describe it unto you. For there be in it ten lesser\\r\\nhouses or innes, and sometimes moe, which are called Innes of the\\r\\nChauncerye. And to every one of them belongeth an hundred students at\\r\\nleast, and to some of them a much greater number, though they be not\\r\\never all together in the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Charles II.\\'s time there were eight Inns of Chancery; and of them\\r\\nthree were subsidiary to the Inner Temple--viz., Clifford\\'s Inn,\\r\\nClement\\'s Inn, and Lyon\\'s Inn. Clifford\\'s Inn (originally the town\\r\\nresidence of the Barons Clifford) was first inhabited by law-students in\\r\\nthe eighteenth year of Edward III. Clement\\'s Inn (taking its name from\\r\\nthe adjacent St. Clement\\'s Well) was certainly inhabited by law-students\\r\\nas early as the nineteenth year of Edward IV. Lyon\\'s Inn was an Inn of\\r\\nChancery in the time of Henry V.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne alone (New Inn) was attached to the Middle Temple. In the previous\\r\\ncentury, the Middle Temple had possessed another Inn of Chancery called\\r\\nStrand Inn; but in the third year of Edward VI. this nursery was pulled\\r\\ndown by the Duke of Somerset, who required the ground on which it stood\\r\\nfor the site of Somerset House.\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn had for dependent schools Furnival\\'s Inn and Thavies\\r\\nInn--the latter of which hostels was inhabited by law-students in Edward\\r\\nIII.\\'s time. Of Furnival\\'s Inn (originally Lord Furnival\\'s town mansion,\\r\\nand converted into a law-school in Edward VI.\\'s reign) Dugdale says:\\r\\n\"After which time the Principall and Fellows of this Inne have paid to\\r\\nthe society of Lincoln\\'s Inne the rent of iiil vis iiid as an yearly\\r\\nrent for the same, as may appear by the accompts of that house; and by\\r\\nspeciall order there made, have had these following priviledges: first\\r\\n(viz. 10 Eliz.), that the utter-barristers of Furnivall\\'s Inne, of a\\r\\nyeares continuance, and so certified and allowed by the Benchers of\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inne, shall pay no more than four marks apiece for their\\r\\nadmittance into that society. Next (viz. in Eliz.) that every fellow of\\r\\nthis inne, who hath been allowed an utter-barrister here, and that hath\\r\\nmooted here two vacations at the Utter Bar, shall pay no more for their\\r\\nadmission into the Society of Lincoln\\'s Inne, than xiiis iiiid, though\\r\\nall utter-barristers of any other Inne of Chancery (excepting Thavyes\\r\\nInne) should pay xxs, and that every inner-barrister of this house, who\\r\\nhath mooted here one vacation at the Inner Bar, should pay for his\\r\\nadmission into this House but xxs, those of other houses (excepting\\r\\nThavyes Inne) paying xxvis viiid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subordinate seminaries of Gray\\'s Inn, in Dugdale\\'s time, were Staple\\r\\nInn and Barnard\\'s Inn. Originally the Exchange of the London woolen\\r\\nmerchants, Staple Inn was a law-school as early as Henry V.\\'s time. It\\r\\nis probable that Bernard\\'s Inn became an academy for law-students in\\r\\nthe reign of Henry VI.\\r\\n\\r\\n[21] Chaucer mentions the Temple thus:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A manciple there was of the Temple, Of which all catours might take\\r\\nensemple For to be wise in buying of vitaile; For whether he pay\\'d or\\r\\ntook by taile, Algate he wayted so in his ashate, That he was aye before\\r\\nin good estate. Now is not that of God a full faire grace, That such a\\r\\nleude man\\'s wit shall pace The wisdome of an heape of learned men? Of\\r\\nmasters had he more than thrice ten, That were of law expert and\\r\\ncurious, Of which there was a dozen in that house, Worthy to been\\r\\nstewards of rent and land Of any lord that is in England; To maken him\\r\\nlive by his proper good In honour debtless, but if he were wood; Or live\\r\\nas scarcely as him list desire, And able to helpen all a shire, In any\\r\\ncase that might have fallen or hap, And yet the manciple set all her\\r\\ncapp.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[22] The \\'De Laudibus\\' was written in Latin; but for the convenience of\\r\\nreaders not familiar with that classic tongue, the quotations from the\\r\\ntreatise are given from Robert Mulcaster\\'s English version.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAWYERS AND GENTLEMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThus planted in the fourteenth century beyond the confines of the city,\\r\\nand within easy access of Westminster Hall, the Inns of Court and\\r\\nChancery formed an university, which soon became almost as powerful and\\r\\nfamous as either Oxford or Cambridge. For generations they were spoken\\r\\nof collectively as the law-university, and though they were voluntary\\r\\nsocieties--in their nature akin to the club-houses of modern\\r\\nLondon--they adopted common rules of discipline, and an uniform system\\r\\nof instruction. Students flocked to them in abundance; and whereas the\\r\\nstudents of Oxford and Cambridge were drawn from the plebeian ranks of\\r\\nsociety, the scholars of the law-university were almost invariably the\\r\\nsons of wealthy men and had usually sprung from gentle families. To be a\\r\\nlaw-student was to be a stripling of quality. The law university enjoyed\\r\\nthe same patrician _prestige_ and _éclat_ that now belong to the more\\r\\naristocratic houses of the old universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoblemen sent their sons to it in order that they might acquire the\\r\\nstyle and learning and accomplishments of polite society. A proportion\\r\\nof the students were encouraged to devote themselves to the study of the\\r\\nlaw and to attend sedulously the sittings of Judges in Westminster Hall;\\r\\nbut the majority of well-descended boys who inhabited the Inns of\\r\\nChancery were heirs to good estates, and were trained to become their\\r\\nwealth rather than to increase it--to perfect themselves in graceful\\r\\narts, rather than to qualify themselves to hold briefs. The same was the\\r\\ncase in the Inns of Court, which were so designated--not because they\\r\\nprepared young men to rise in courts of law, but because they taught\\r\\nthem to shine in the palaces of kings. It is a mistake to suppose that\\r\\nthe Inns of Court contain at the present time a larger proportion of\\r\\nidle members, who have no intention to practise at the bar, than they\\r\\ncontained under the Plantagenets and Tudors. On the contrary, in the\\r\\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the number of Templars who merely\\r\\nplayed at being lawyers, or were lawyers only in name, was actually as\\r\\nwell as relatively greater than the merely _nominal_ lawyers of the\\r\\nTemple at the present time. For several generations, and for two\\r\\ncenturies after Sir John Fortescue wrote the \\'De Laudibus,\\' the\\r\\nInns-of-Court man was more busied in learning to sing than in learning\\r\\nto argue a law cause, more desirous to fence with a sword than to fence\\r\\nwith logic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Notwithstanding,\" runs Mulcaster\\'s translation of the \\'De\\r\\nLaudibus,\\'[23] \"the same lawes are taught and learned, in a certaine\\r\\nplace of publique or common studie, more convenient and apt for\\r\\nattayninge to the knowledge of them, than any other university. For\\r\\ntheyr place of studie is situate nigh to the Kinges Courts, where the\\r\\nsame lawes are pleaded and argued, and judgements by the same given by\\r\\njudges, men of gravitie, auncient in yeares, perfit and graduate in the\\r\\nsame lawes. Wherefore, euerie day in court, the students in those lawes\\r\\nresorte by great numbers into those courts wherein the same lawes are\\r\\nread and taught, as it were in common schooles. This place of studie is\\r\\nfar betweene the place of the said courts and the cittie of London,\\r\\nwhich of all thinges necessarie is the plentifullest of all cities and\\r\\ntownes of the realme. So that the said place of studie is not situate\\r\\nwithin the cittie, where the confluence of people might disturb the\\r\\nquietnes of the studentes, but somewhat severall in the suburbes of the\\r\\nsame cittie, and nigher to the saide courts, that the studentes may\\r\\ndayelye at their pleasure have accesse and recourse thither without\\r\\nweariness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting forth the condition and pursuits of law-students in his day, Sir\\r\\nJohn Fortesque continues; \"For in these greater inns, there can no\\r\\nstudent bee mayntayned for lesse expenses by the yeare than twentye\\r\\nmarkes. And if hee have a servaunt to wait uppon him, as most of them\\r\\nhave, then so much the greater will his charges bee. Nowe, by reason of\\r\\nthis charge, the children onely of noblemenne doo studye the lawes in\\r\\nthose innes. For the poore and common sorte of the people are not able\\r\\nto bear so great charges for the exhibytion of theyr chyldren. And\\r\\nMarchaunt menne can seldome finde in theyr heartes to hynder theyr\\r\\nmerchaundise with so greate yearly expenses. And it thus falleth out\\r\\nthat there is scant anye man founde within the realme skilfull and\\r\\ncunning in the lawes, except he be a gentleman borne, and come of noble\\r\\nstocke. Wherefore they more than any other kinde of men have a speciall\\r\\nregarde to their nobility, and to the preservation of their honor and\\r\\nfame. And to speake upryghtlye, there is in these greater innes, yea,\\r\\nand in the lesser too, beside the studie of the lawes, as it were an\\r\\nuniversity or schoole of all commendable qualities requisite for noble\\r\\nmen. There they learn to sing, and to exercise themselves in all kinde\\r\\nof harmonye. There also they practice daunsing, and other noblemen\\'s\\r\\npastimes, as they use to do, which are brought up in the king\\'s house.\\r\\nOn the working dayes, the most of them apply themselves to the studye of\\r\\nthe lawe, and on the holye dayes to the studye of holye Scripture;[24]\\r\\nand out of the tyme of divine service, to the reading of Chronicles. For\\r\\nthere indeede are vertues studied, and vices exiled. So that, for the\\r\\nendowment of vertue, and abandoning of vice, Knights and Barrons, with\\r\\nother states and noblemen of the realme, place their children in those\\r\\ninnes, though they desire not to have them learned in the lawes, nor to\\r\\nlieue by the practice thereof, but onely uppon their father\\'s allowance.\\r\\nScant at anye tyme is there heard among them any sedition, chyding, or\\r\\ngrudging, and yet the offenders are punished with none other payne, but\\r\\nonely to bee amooved from the compayne of their fellowshippe. Which\\r\\npunishment they doo more feare than other criminall offendours doo feare\\r\\nimprisonment and yrons: For hee that is once expelled from anye of those\\r\\nfellowshippes is never received to bee a felowe in any of the other\\r\\nfellowshippes. And so by this means there is continuall peace; and their\\r\\ndemeanor is lyke the behaviour of such as are coupled together in\\r\\nperfect amytie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAny person familiar with the Inns of Court at the present time will see\\r\\nhow closely the law-colleges of Victoria\\'s London resemble in many\\r\\nimportant particulars the law-colleges of Fortescue\\'s period. After the\\r\\nfashion of four centuries since young men are still induced to enter\\r\\nthem for the sake of honorable companionship, good society, and social\\r\\nprestige, rather than for the sake of legal education. After the remarks\\r\\nalready made with regard to musical lawyers in a previous section of\\r\\nthis work, it is needless to say that Inns of Court men are not\\r\\nremarkable for their application to vocal harmony; but the younger\\r\\nmembers are still remarkable for the zeal with which they endeavor to\\r\\nmaster the accomplishments which distinguish men of fashion and tone. If\\r\\nthe nominal (sometimes they are called \\'ornamental\\') barristers of the\\r\\nfifteenth century liked to read the Holy Scriptures, the young lawyers\\r\\nof the nineteenth century are no less disposed to read their Bibles\\r\\ncritically, and argue as to the merits of Bishop Colenso and his\\r\\nopponents. Moreover, the discipline described by Fortescue is still\\r\\nfound sufficient to maintain order in the inns.\\r\\n\\r\\nWriting more than a century after Fortescue, Sir John Ferne, in his\\r\\n\\'Blazon of Gentrie, the Glory of Generosity, and the Lacy\\'s Nobility,\\'\\r\\nobserves: \"Nobleness of blood, joyned with virtue, compteth the person\\r\\nas most meet to the enterprize of any public service; and for that cause\\r\\nit was not for nought that our antient governors in this land, did with\\r\\na special foresight and wisdom provide, that none should be admitted\\r\\ninto the Houses of Court, being seminaries sending forth men apt to the\\r\\ngovernment of justice, except he were a gentleman of blood. And that\\r\\nthis may seem a truth, I myself have seen a kalendar of all those which\\r\\nwere together in the society of one of the same houses, about the last\\r\\nyear of King Henry the Fifth, with the armes of their House and family\\r\\nmarshalled by their names; and I assure you, the self same monument doth\\r\\nboth approve them all to be gentlemen of perfect descents and also the\\r\\nnumber of them much less than now it is, being at that time in one house\\r\\nscarcely three score.\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis passage from an author who delighted to magnify the advantages of\\r\\ngenerous descent, has contributed to the very general and erroneous\\r\\nimpression that until comparatively recent times the members of the\\r\\nEnglish bar were necessarily drawn from the highest ranks of society;\\r\\nand several excellent writers on the antiquities of the law have laid\\r\\naside their customary caution and strengthened Ferne\\'s words with\\r\\ninaccurate comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Pearce says of the author of the \\'Glory of Generositie\\'--\"He was\\r\\none of the advocates for excluding from the Inns of Court all who were\\r\\nnot \\'a gentleman by blood,\\' according to the ancient rule mentioned by\\r\\nFortescue, which seems to have been disregarded in Elizabeth\\'s time.\"\\r\\nFortescue nowhere mentions any such rule, but attributes the\\r\\naristocratic character of the law-colleges to the high cost of\\r\\nmembership. Far from implying that men of mean extraction were excluded\\r\\nby an express prohibition, his words justify the inference that no such\\r\\nrule existed in his time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Inns-of-Court men were for many generations gentlemen by birth\\r\\nalmost without a single exception, it yet remains to be proved that\\r\\nplebeian birth at any period disqualified persons for admission to the\\r\\nlaw-colleges. If such a restriction ever existed it had disappeared\\r\\nbefore the close of the fifteenth century--a period not favorable to the\\r\\nviews of those who were most anxious to remove the barriers placed by\\r\\nfeudal society between the gentle and the vulgar. Sir John More (the\\r\\nfather of the famous Sir Thomas) was a Judge in the King\\'s Bench,\\r\\nalthough his parentage was obscure; and it is worthy of notice that he\\r\\nwas a successful lawyer of Fortescue\\'s period. Lord Chancellor Audley\\r\\nwas not entitled to bear arms by birth, but was merely the son of a\\r\\nprosperous yeoman. The lowliness of his extraction cannot have been any\\r\\nserious impediment to him, for before the end of his thirty-sixth year\\r\\nhe was a sergeant. In the following century the inns received a steadily\\r\\nincreasing number of students, who either lacked generous lineage or\\r\\nwere the offspring of shameful love. For instance, Chief Justice Wray\\'s\\r\\nbirth was scandalous; and if Lord Ellesmere in his youth reflected with\\r\\npride on the dignity of his father, Sir Richard Egerton, he had reason\\r\\nto blush for his mother. Ferne\\'s lament over the loss of heraldric\\r\\nvirtue and splendor, which the inns had sustained in his time, testifies\\r\\nto the presence of a considerable plebeian element amongst the members\\r\\nof the law-university. But that which was marked in the sixteenth was\\r\\nfar more apparent in the seventeenth century. Scroggs\\'s enemies were\\r\\nwrong in stigmatizing him as a butcher\\'s son, for the odious chief\\r\\njustice was born and bred a gentleman, and Jeffreys could boast a decent\\r\\nextraction; but there is abundance of evidence that throughout the\\r\\nreigns of the Stuarts the inns swarmed with low-born adventurers. The\\r\\ncareer of Chief Justice Saunders, who, beginning as a \"poor beggar boy,\"\\r\\nof unknown parentage, raised himself to the Chiefship of the King\\'s\\r\\nBench, shows how low an origin a judge might have in the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury. To mention the names of such men as Parker, King, Yorke, Ryder,\\r\\nand the Scotts, without placing beside them the names of such men as\\r\\nHenley, Harcourt, Bathurst, Talbot, Murray, and Erskine, would tend to\\r\\ncreate an erroneous impression that in the eighteenth century the bar\\r\\nceased to comprise amongst its industrious members a large aristocratic\\r\\nelement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of barristers, however, who in that period brought themselves\\r\\nby talent and honorable perseverance into the foremost rank of the legal\\r\\nprofession in spite of humble birth, unquestionably shows that ambitious\\r\\nmen from the obscure middle classes were more frequently than in any\\r\\nprevious century found pushing their fortunes in Westminster Hall. Lord\\r\\nMacclesfield was the son of an attorney whose parents were of lowly\\r\\norigin, and whose worldly means were even lower than their ancestral\\r\\ncondition. Lord Chancellor King\\'s father was a grocer and salter who\\r\\ncarried on a retail business at Exeter; and in his youth the Chancellor\\r\\nhimself had acted as his father\\'s apprentice--standing behind the\\r\\ncounter and wearing the apron and sleeves of a grocer\\'s servitor. Philip\\r\\nYorke was the son of a country attorney who could boast neither wealth\\r\\nnor gentle descent. Chief Justice Ryder was the son of a mercer whose\\r\\nshop stood in West Smithfield, and grandson of a dissenting minister,\\r\\nwho, though he bore the name, is not known to have inherited the blood\\r\\nof the Yorkshire Ryders. Sir William Blackstone was the fourth son of a\\r\\nsilkman and citizen of London. Lords Stowell and Eldon were the children\\r\\nof a provincial tradesman. The learned and good Sir Samuel Romilly\\'s\\r\\nfather was Peter Romilly, jeweller, of Frith Street, Soho. Such were the\\r\\norigins of some of the men who won the prizes of the law in\\r\\ncomparatively recent times. The present century has produced an even\\r\\ngreater number of barristers who have achieved eminence, and are able to\\r\\nsay with honest pride that they are the _first_ gentlemen mentioned in\\r\\ntheir pedigrees; and so thoroughly has the bar become an open\\r\\nprofession, accessible to all persons[26] who have the means of\\r\\ngentlemen, that no barrister at the present time would have the bad\\r\\ntaste or foolish hardihood to express openly his regret that the members\\r\\nof a liberal profession should no longer pay a hurtful attention to\\r\\nilliberal distinctions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Fortescue, the law-students belonging at the same time to\\r\\nthe Inns of Court and Chancery numbered _at least_ one thousand eight\\r\\nhundred in the fifteenth century; and it may be fairly inferred from his\\r\\nwords that their number considerably exceeded two thousand. To each of\\r\\nthe ten Inns of Chancery the author of the \\'De Laudibus\\' assigns \"an\\r\\nhundred students at the least, and to some of them a much greater\\r\\nnumber;\" and he says that the least populous of the four Inns of Court\\r\\ncontained \"two hundred students or thereabouts.\" At the present time the\\r\\nnumber of barristers--together with Fellows of the College of Advocates,\\r\\nand certificated special pleaders and conveyancers not at the bar--is\\r\\nshown by the Law List for 1866 to be somewhat more than 4800.[27] Even\\r\\nwhen it is borne in mind how much the legal business of the whole nation\\r\\nhas necessarily increased with the growth of our commercial\\r\\nprosperity--it being at the same time remembered, upon the other hand,\\r\\nhow many times the population of the country has doubled itself since\\r\\nthe wars of the Roses--few persons will be of opinion that the legal\\r\\nprofession, either by the number of its practitioners or its command of\\r\\nemployment, is a more conspicuous and prosperous power at the present\\r\\ntime than it was in the fifteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerne was by no means the only gentleman of Elizabethan London to\\r\\ndeplore the rapid increase in the number of lawyers, and to regret the\\r\\ngrowing liberality which encouraged--or rather the national prosperity\\r\\nwhich enabled--men of inferior parentage to adopt the law as a\\r\\nprofession. In his address on Mr. Clerke\\'s elevation to the dignity of a\\r\\nsergeant, Lord Chancellor Hatton, echoing the common complaint\\r\\nconcerning the degradation of the law through the swarms of plebeian\\r\\nstudents and practitioners, observed--\"Let not the dignitie of the lawe\\r\\nbe geven to men unmeete. And I do exhorte you all that are heare present\\r\\nnot to call men to the barre or the benches that are so unmeete. I finde\\r\\nthat there are now more at the barre in one house than there was in all\\r\\nthe Innes of Court when I was a younge man.\" Notwithstanding the\\r\\nChancellor\\'s earnest statement of his personal recollection of the state\\r\\nof things when he was a young man, there is reason to think that he was\\r\\nquite in error in thinking that lawyers had increased so greatly in\\r\\nnumber. From a MS. in Lord Burleigh\\'s collection, it appears that in\\r\\n1586 the number of law-students, resident during term, was only 1703--a\\r\\nsmaller number than that which Fortescue computed the entire population\\r\\nof the London law-students, at a time when civil war had cruelly\\r\\ndiminished the number of men likely to join an aristocratic university.\\r\\nSir Edward Coke estimated the roll of Elizabethan law-students at one\\r\\nthousand, half their number in Fortescue\\'s time. Coke, however, confined\\r\\nhis attention in this matter to the Students of Inns of Court, and paid\\r\\nno attention to Inns of Chancery. Either Hatton greatly exaggerated the\\r\\nincrease of the legal working profession; or in previous times the\\r\\nproportion of law-students who never became barristers greatly exceeded\\r\\nthose who were ultimately called to the bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething more than a hundred years later, the old cry against the\\r\\nlow-born adventurers, who, to the injury of the public and the\\r\\ndegradation of the law, were said to overwhelm counsellors and\\r\\nsolicitors of superior tone and pedigree, was still frequently heard in\\r\\nthe coteries of disappointed candidates for employment in Westminster\\r\\nHall, and on the lips of men whose hopes of achieving social distinction\\r\\nwere likely to be frustrated so long as plebeian learning and energy\\r\\nwere permitted to have free action. In his \\'History of Hertfordshire\\'\\r\\n(published in 1700), Sir Henry Chauncey, Sergeant-at-Law, exclaims: \"But\\r\\nnow these mechanicks, ambitious of rule and government, often educate\\r\\ntheir sons in these seminaries of law, whereby they overstock the\\r\\nprofession, and so make it contemptible; whilst the gentry, not sensible\\r\\nof the mischief they draw upon themselves, but also upon the nation,\\r\\nprefer them in their business before their own children, whom they\\r\\nbereave of their employment, formerly designed for their support;\\r\\nqualifying their servants, by the profit of this profession, to purchase\\r\\ntheir estates, and by this means make them their lords and masters,\\r\\nwhilst they lessen the trade of the kingdom, and cause a scarcity of\\r\\nhusbandmen, workmen, artificers, and servants in the nation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the Inns of Court became less and less aristocratic throughout the\\r\\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries there is no reason to doubt; but it\\r\\nmay be questioned whether it was so overstocked with competent working\\r\\nmembers, as poor Sir Henry Chauncey imagined it. Describing the state of\\r\\nthe inns some two generations later, Blackstone computed the number of\\r\\nlaw-students at about a thousand, perhaps slightly more; and he observes\\r\\nthat in his time the merely _nominal_ law-students were comparatively\\r\\nfew. \"Wherefore,\" he says, \"few gentlemen now resort to the Inns of\\r\\nCourt, but such for whom the knowledge of practice is absolutely\\r\\nnecessary; such, I mean, as are intended for the profession; the rest of\\r\\nour gentry, (not to say our nobility also) having usually retired to\\r\\ntheir estates, or visited foreign kingdoms, or entered upon public life,\\r\\nwithout any instruction in the laws of the land, and indeed with hardly\\r\\nany opportunity of gaining instruction, unless it can be afforded to\\r\\nthem in the universities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe folly of those who lamented that men of plebeian rank were allowed\\r\\nto adopt the legal profession as a means of livelihood, was however\\r\\nexceeded by the folly of men of another sort, who endeavored to hide the\\r\\nhumble extractions of eminent lawyers, under the ingenious falsehoods of\\r\\nfictitious pedigrees. In the last century, no sooner had a lawyer of\\r\\nhumble birth risen to distinction, than he was pestered by fabricators\\r\\nof false genealogies, who implored him to accept their silly romances\\r\\nabout his ancestry. In most cases, these ridiculous applicants hoped to\\r\\nreceive money for their dishonest representations; but not seldom it\\r\\nhappened that they were actuated by a sincere desire to protect the\\r\\nheraldic honor of the law from the aspersions of those who maintained\\r\\nthat a man might fight his way to the woolsack, although his father had\\r\\nbeen a tender of swine. Sometimes these imaginative chroniclers, not\\r\\ncontent with fabricating a genealogical chart for a _parvenu_ Lord\\r\\nChancellor, insisted that he should permit them to write their lives in\\r\\nsuch a fashion, that their earlier experiences should seem to be in\\r\\nharmony with their later fortunes. Lord Macclesfield (the son of a poor\\r\\nand ill-descended country attorney), was traced by officious adulators\\r\\nto Reginald Le Parker, who accompanied Edward I., while Prince of Wales,\\r\\nto the Holy Land. In like manner a manufacturer of genealogies traced\\r\\nLord Eldon to Sir Michael Scott of Balwearie. When one of this servile\\r\\nschool of worshippers approached Lord Thurlow with an assurance that he\\r\\nwas of kin with Cromwell\\'s secretary Thurloe, the Chancellor, with bluff\\r\\nhonesty, responded, \"Sir, as Mr. Secretary Thurloe was, like myself, a\\r\\nSuffolk man, you have an excuse for your mistake. In the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury two Thurlows, who were in no way related to each other,\\r\\nflourished in Suffolk. One was Cromwell\\'s secretary Thurloe, the other\\r\\nwas Thurlow, the Suffolk carrier. I am descended from the carrier.\"\\r\\nNotwithstanding Lord Thurlow\\'s frequent and consistent disavowals of\\r\\npretension to any heraldic pedigree, his collateral descendants are\\r\\ncredited in the \\'Peerages\\' with a descent from an ancient family.\\r\\n\\r\\n[23] This charming book was written during the author\\'s exile, which\\r\\nbegan in 1463.\\r\\n\\r\\n[24] This passage is one of several passages in Pre-reformation English\\r\\nliterature which certify that the Bible was much more widely and\\r\\ncarefully read by lettered and studious layman, in times prior to the\\r\\nrupture between England and Rome, than many persons are aware, and some\\r\\nviolent writers like to acknowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[25] Pathetically deploring the change wrought by time, Ferne also\\r\\nobserves of the Inns of Court,--\"Pity to see the same places, through\\r\\nthe malignity of the times, and the negligence of those which should\\r\\nhave had care to the same, been altered quite from their first\\r\\ninstitution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[26] It is not unusual now-a-days to see on the screened list of\\r\\nstudents about to be called to the bar the names of gentlemen who have\\r\\ncaused themselves to be described in the quasi-public lists as the sons\\r\\nof tradesmen. Some few years since a gentleman who has already made his\\r\\nname known amongst juniors, was thus \\'screened\\'in the four halls as the\\r\\nson of a petty tradesman in an obscure quarter of London; and assuming\\r\\nthat his conduct was due to self-respect and affectionate regard for his\\r\\nparent, it seemed to most observers that the young lawyer, in thus\\r\\nfrankly stating his lowly origin, acted with spirit and dignity. It may\\r\\nbe that years hence this highly-accomplished gentleman will, like Lord\\r\\nTenterden and Lord St. Leonards (both of whom were the sons of honest\\r\\nbut humble tradesmen), see his name placed upon the roll of England\\'s\\r\\nhereditary noblesse.\\r\\n\\r\\n[27] Of this number about 2500 reside in or near London and maintain\\r\\nsome apparent connexion with the Inns of Court. Of the remainder, some\\r\\nreside in Scotland, some in Ireland, some in the English provinces, some\\r\\nin the colonies; whilst some of them, although their names are still on\\r\\nthe Law List, have ceased to regard themselves as members of the legal\\r\\nprofession.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAW-FRENCH AND LAW-LATIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo circumstances of the Norman Conquest more forcibly illustrate the\\r\\nhumiliation of the conquered people, than the measures by which the\\r\\ninvaders imposed their language on the public courts of the country, and\\r\\nendeavored to make it permanently usurp the place of the mother-tongue\\r\\nof the despised multitude; and no fact more signally displays our\\r\\nconservative temper than the general reluctance of English society to\\r\\nrelinquish the use of the French words and phrases which still tincture\\r\\nthe language of parliament, and the procedures of Westminster Hall,\\r\\nrecalling to our minds the insolent domination of a few powerful\\r\\nfamilies who occupied our country by force, and ruled our forefathers\\r\\nwith vigorous injustice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrenchmen by birth, education, sympathy, William\\'s barons did their\\r\\nutmost to make England a new France: and for several generations the\\r\\ndescendants of the successful invaders were no less eager to abolish\\r\\nevery usage which could remind the vanquished race of their lost\\r\\nsupremacy. French became the language of parliament and the\\r\\ncouncil-chamber. It was spoken by the judges who dispensed justice in\\r\\nthe name of a French king, and by the lawyers who followed the royal\\r\\ncourt in the train of the French-speaking judges. In the hunting-field\\r\\nand the lists no gentleman entitled to bear coat-armour deigned to utter\\r\\na word of English: it was the same in Fives\\' Court and at the\\r\\ngambling-table. Schoolmasters were ordered to teach their pupils to\\r\\nconstrue from Latin into French, instead of into English; and young men\\r\\nof Anglo-Saxon extraction, bent on rising in the world by native talent\\r\\nand Norman patronage, labored to acquire the language of the ruling\\r\\nclass and forget the accents of their ancestors. The language and usages\\r\\nof modern England abound with traces of the French of this period. To\\r\\nevery act that obtained the royal assent during last session of\\r\\nparliament, the queen said \"La reyne le veult.\" Every bill which is sent\\r\\nup from the Commons to the Lords, an officer of the lower house endorses\\r\\nwith \"Soit bailé aux Seigneurs;\" and no bill is ever sent down from the\\r\\nLords to the Commons until a corresponding officer of the upper house\\r\\nhas written on its back, \"Soit bailé aux Communes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn like manner our parochial usages, local sports, and domestic games\\r\\ncontinually remind us of the obstinate tenacity with which the\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon race has preserved, and still preserves, the vestiges of its\\r\\nancient subjection to a foreign yoke. The crier of a country town, in\\r\\nany of England\\'s fertile provinces, never proclaims the loss of a\\r\\nyeoman\\'s sporting-dog, the auction of a bankrupt dealer\\'s\\r\\nstock-in-trade, or the impounding of a strayed cow, until he has\\r\\ncommanded, in Norman-French, the attention of the sleepy rustics. The\\r\\nlanguage of the stable and the kennel is rich in traces of Norman\\r\\ninfluence; and in backgammon, as played by orthodox players, we have a\\r\\nsuggestive memorial of those Norman nobles, of whom Fortescue, in the\\r\\n\\'De Laudibus\\' observes: \"Neither had they delyght to hunt, and to\\r\\nexercise other sportes and pastimes, as dyce-play and the hand-ball, but\\r\\nin their own proper tongue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn behalf of the Norman _noblesse_ it should be borne in mind that their\\r\\npolicy in this matter was less intentionally vexatious and insolent than\\r\\nit has appeared to superficial observers. In the great majority of\\r\\ncauses the suitors were Frenchmen; and it was just as reasonable that\\r\\nthey should like to understand the arguments of their counsel and\\r\\njudges, as it is reasonable for suitors in the present day to require\\r\\nthe proceedings in Westminster Hall to be clothed in the language most\\r\\nfamiliar to the majority of persons seeking justice in its courts. If\\r\\nthe use of French pleadings was hard on the one Anglo-Saxon suitor who\\r\\ndemanded justice in Henry I.\\'s time, the use of English pleadings would\\r\\nhave been equally annoying to the nine French gentlemen who appeared for\\r\\nthe same purpose in the king\\'s court. It was greatly to be desired that\\r\\nthe two races should have one common language; and common sense ordained\\r\\nthat the tongue of the one or the other race should be adopted as the\\r\\nnational language. Which side therefore was to be at the pains to learn\\r\\na new tongue? Should the conquerors labor to acquire Anglo-Saxon? or\\r\\nshould the conquered be required to learn French? In these days the\\r\\ncultivated Englishmen who hold India by military force, even as the\\r\\nNorman invaders held England, by the right of might, settle a similar\\r\\nquestion by taking upon themselves the trouble of learning as much of\\r\\nthe Asiatic dialects as is necessary for purposes of business. But the\\r\\nNorman barons were not cultivated; and for many generations ignorance\\r\\nwas with them an affair of pride no less than of constitutional\\r\\ninclination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon ambitious Englishmen acquired the new language, in order to use it\\r\\nas an instrument for personal advancement. The Saxon stripling who could\\r\\nkeep accounts in Norman fashion, and speak French as fluently as his\\r\\nmother tongue, might hope to sell his knowledge in a good market. As the\\r\\nsteward of a Norman baron he might negotiate between my lord and my\\r\\nlord\\'s tenants, letting my lord know as much of his tenant\\'s wishes, and\\r\\nrevealing to the tenants as much of their lord\\'s intentions as suited\\r\\nhis purpose. Uniting in his own person the powers of interpreter,\\r\\narbitrator, and steward, he possessed enviable opportunities and\\r\\nfacilities for acquiring wealth. Not seldom, when he had grown rich, or\\r\\nwhilst his fortunes were in the ascendant, he assumed a French name as\\r\\nwell as a French accent; and having persuaded himself and his younger\\r\\nneighbors that he was a Frenchman, he in some cases bequeathed to his\\r\\nchildren an ample estate and a Norman pedigree. In certain causes in the\\r\\nlaw courts the agent (by whatever title known) who was a perfect master\\r\\nof the three languages (French, Latin, and English) had greatly the\\r\\nadvantage over an opposing agent who could speak only French and Latin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the Conquest till the latter half of the fourteenth century the\\r\\npleadings in courts of justice were in Norman-French; but in the 36 Ed.\\r\\nIII., it was ordained by the king \"that all plees, which be to be pleded\\r\\nin any of his courts, before any of his justices; or in his other\\r\\nplaces; or before any of his other ministers; or in the courts and\\r\\nplaces of any other lords within the realm, shall be pleded, shewed, and\\r\\ndefended, answered, debated, and judged in the English tongue, and that\\r\\nthey be entred and enrolled in Latine. And that the laws and customs of\\r\\nthe same realm, termes, and processes, be holden and kept as they be,\\r\\nand have been before this time; and that by the antient termes and forms\\r\\nof the declarations no man be prejudiced; so that the matter of the\\r\\naction be fully shewed in the demonstration and in the writ.\" Long\\r\\nbefore this wise measure of reform was obtained by the urgent wishes of\\r\\nthe nation, the French of the law courts had become so corrupt and\\r\\nunlike the language of the invaders, that it was scarcely more\\r\\nintelligible to educated natives of France than to most Englishmen of\\r\\nthe highest rank. A jargon compounded of French and Latin, none save\\r\\nprofessional lawyers could translate it with readiness or accuracy; and\\r\\nwhilst it unquestionably kept suitors in ignorance of their own affairs,\\r\\nthere is reason to believe that it often perplexed the most skilful of\\r\\nthose official interpreters who were never weary of extolling his\\r\\nlucidity and precision.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though English lawyers were thus expressly forbidden in 1362 to\\r\\nplead in Law-French, they persisted in using the hybrid jargon for\\r\\nreports and treatises so late as George II.\\'s reign; and for an equal\\r\\nlength of time they seized every occasion to introduce scraps of\\r\\nLaw-French into their speeches at the bars of the different courts. It\\r\\nshould be observed that these antiquarian advocates were enabled thus to\\r\\ndisplay their useless erudition by the provisions of King Edward\\'s act,\\r\\nwhich, while it forbade French _pleadings_, specially ordained the\\r\\nretention of French terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger North\\'s essay \\'On the study of the Laws\\' contains amusing\\r\\ntestimony to the affection with which the lawyers of his day regarded\\r\\ntheir Law-French, and also shows how largely it was used till the close\\r\\nof the seventeenth century by the orators of Westminster Hall. \"Here I\\r\\nmust stay to observe,\" says the author, enthusiastically, \"the\\r\\nnecessity of a student\\'s early application to learn the old Law-French,\\r\\nfor these books, and most others of considerable authority, are\\r\\ndelivered in it. Some may think that because the Law-French is no better\\r\\nthan the old Norman corrupted, and now a deformed hotch-potch of the\\r\\nEnglish and Latin mixed together, it is not fit for a polite spark to\\r\\nfoul himself with; but this nicety is so desperate a mistake, that\\r\\nlawyer and Law-French are coincident; one will not stand without the\\r\\nother.\" So enamored was he of the grace and excellence of law-reporters\\'\\r\\nFrench, that he regarded it as a delightful study for a man of fashion,\\r\\nand maintained that no barrister would do justice to the law and the\\r\\ninterests of his clients who did not season his sentences with Norman\\r\\nverbiage. \"The law,\" he held, \"is scarcely expressible properly in\\r\\nEnglish, and when it is done, it must be _Françoise_, or very uncouth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward III.\\'s measure prohibitory of French pleadings had therefore\\r\\ncomparatively little influence on the educational course of\\r\\nlaw-students. The published reports of trials, known by the name of\\r\\nYear-Books, were composed in French, until the series terminated in the\\r\\ntime of Henry VIII.; and so late as George II.\\'s reign, Chief Baron\\r\\nComyn preferred such words as \\'chemin,\\' \\'dismes,\\' and \\'baron and feme,\\'\\r\\nto such words as \\'highway,\\' \\'tithes,\\' \\'husband and wife.\\' More liberal\\r\\nthan the majority of his legal brethren, even as his enlightenment with\\r\\nregard to public affairs exceeded that of ordinary politicians of his\\r\\ntime, Sir Edward Coke wrote his commentaries in English, but when he\\r\\npublished them, he felt it right to soothe the alarm of lawyers by\\r\\nassuring them that his departure from ancient usage could have no\\r\\ndisastrous consequences. \"I cannot conjecture,\" he apologetically\\r\\nobserves in his preface, \"that the general communicating these laws in\\r\\nthe English tongue can work any inconvenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the primary text-books of legal lore had been rendered into\\r\\nEnglish, and some most valuable treatises had been written and published\\r\\nin the mother tongue of the country; but in the seventeenth century no\\r\\nInns-of-Court man could acquire an adequate acquaintance with the usages\\r\\nand rules of our courts and the decisions of past judges, until he was\\r\\nable to study the Year-Books and read Littleton in the original. To\\r\\nacquire this singular language--a _dead_ tongue that cannot be said to\\r\\nhave ever lived--was the first object of the law-student. He worked at\\r\\nit in his chamber, and with faltering and uncertain accents essayed to\\r\\nspeak it at the periodic mootings in which he was required to take part\\r\\nbefore he could be called to the bar, and also after he had become an\\r\\nutter-barrister. In his \\'Autobiography,\\' Sir Simonds D\\'Ewes makes\\r\\nmention in several places of his Law-French exercises (_temp._ James\\r\\nI.), and in one place of his personal story he observes, \"I had twice\\r\\nmooted in Law-French before I was called to the bar, and several times\\r\\nafter I was made an utter-barrister, in our open hall. Thrice also\\r\\nbefore I was of the bar, I argued the reader\\'s cases at the Inns of\\r\\nChancery publicly, and six times afterwards. And then also, being an\\r\\nutter-barrister, I had twice argued our Middle-Temple reader\\'s case at\\r\\nthe cupboard, and sat nine times in our hall at the bench, and argued\\r\\nsuch cases in English as had before been argued by young gentlemen or\\r\\nutter-barristers in Law-French bareheaded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the excellent changes by which the more enlightened of the\\r\\nCommonwealth lawyers sought to lessen the public clamor of law-reform\\r\\nwas the resolution that all legal records should be kept, and all writs\\r\\ncomposed, in the language of the country. Hitherto the law records had\\r\\nbeen kept in a Latin that was quite as barbarous as the French used by\\r\\nthe reporters; and the determination to abolish a custom which served\\r\\nonly to obscure the operations of justice and to confound the illiterate\\r\\nwas hailed by the more intelligent purchasers of law as a notable step\\r\\nin the right direction. But the reform was by no means acceptable to the\\r\\nmajority of the bar, who did not hesitate to stigmatize the measure as a\\r\\ndangerous innovation--which would prove injurious to learned lawyers and\\r\\npeace-loving citizens, although it might possibly serve the purposes of\\r\\nignorant counsel and litigious \\'lay gents.\\'[28]The legal literature of\\r\\nthree generations following Charles I.\\'s execution abounds with\\r\\ncontemptuous allusions to the \\'English times\\' of Cromwell; the\\r\\nold-fashioned reporters, hugging their Norman-French and looking with\\r\\nsuspicion on popular intelligence, were vehement in expressing their\\r\\ncontempt for the prevalent misuse of the mother tongue. \"I have,\"\\r\\nobserves Styles, in the preface to his reports, \"made these reports\\r\\nspeak English; not that I believe that they will be thereby more\\r\\ngenerally useful, for I have always been and yet am of opinion, that\\r\\nthat part of the Common Law which is in the English hath only occasioned\\r\\nthe making of unquiet spirits contentiously knowing, and more apt to\\r\\noffend others than to defend themselves; but I have done it in obedience\\r\\nto authority, and to stop the mouths of such of this English age, who,\\r\\nthough they be confessedly different in their minds and judgments, as\\r\\nthe builders of Babel were in their language, yet do think it vain, if\\r\\nnot impious, to speak or understand more than their own mother tongue.\"\\r\\nIn like manner, Whitelock\\'s uncle Bulstrode, the celebrated reporter,\\r\\nsays of the second part of his reports, \"that he had manny years since\\r\\nperfected the words in French, in which language he had desired it\\r\\nmight have seen the light, being most proper for it, and most convenient\\r\\nfor the professors of the law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe restorers who raised Charles II. to his father\\'s throne, lost no\\r\\ntime in recalling Latin to the records and writs; and so gladly did the\\r\\nreporters and the practising counsel avail themselves of the reaction in\\r\\nfavor of discarded usages, that more Law-French was written and talked\\r\\nin Westminster Hall during the time of the restored king, than had been\\r\\npenned and spoken throughout the first fifty years of the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vexatious and indescribably absurd use of Law-Latin in records,\\r\\nwrits, and written pleadings, was finally put an end to by statute 4\\r\\nGeorge II. c. 26; but this bill, which discarded for legal processes a\\r\\ncumbrous and harsh language, that was alike unmusical and inexact, and\\r\\nwould have been utterly unintelligible to a Roman gentleman of the\\r\\nAugustan period, did not become law without much opposition from some of\\r\\nthe authorities of Westminster Hall. Lord Raymond, Chief Justice of the\\r\\nKing\\'s Bench, spoke in accordance with opinions that had many supporters\\r\\non the bench and at the bar, when he expressed his warm disapprobation\\r\\nof the proposed measure, and sarcastically observed \"that if the bill\\r\\npaused, the law might likewise be translated into Welsh, since many in\\r\\nWales understood not English.\" In the same spirit Sir Willian Blackstone\\r\\nand more recent authorities have lamented the loss of Law-Latin. Lord\\r\\nCampbell, in the \\'Chancellors,\\' records that he \"heard the late Lord\\r\\nEllenborough from the bench regret the change, on the ground that it had\\r\\nhad the tendency to make attorneys illiterate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sneer by which Lord Raymond endeavored to cast discredit on the\\r\\nproposal to abolish Law-Latin, was recalled after the lapse of many\\r\\nyears by Sergeant Heywood, who forthwith acted upon it as though it\\r\\noriginated in serious thought. Whilst acting as Chief Justice of the\\r\\nCarmarthen Circuit, the sergeant was presiding over a trial of murder,\\r\\nwhen it was discovered that neither the prisoner, nor any member of the\\r\\njury, could understand a word of English; under these circumstances it\\r\\nwas suggested that the evidence and the charge should be explained\\r\\n_verbatim_, to the prisoner and his twelve triers by an interpreter. To\\r\\nthis reasonable petition that the testimony should be presented in a\\r\\nWelsh dress, the judge replied that, \"to accede to the request would be\\r\\nto repeal the act of parliament, which required that all proceedings in\\r\\ncourts of justice should be in the English tongue, and that the case of\\r\\na trial in Wales, in which the prisoner and jury should not understand\\r\\nEnglish, was a case not provided for, although the attention of the\\r\\nlegislature had been called to it by that great judge Lord Raymond.\" The\\r\\njudge having thus decided, the inquiry proceeded--without the help of an\\r\\ninterpreter--the counsel for the prosecution favoring the jury with an\\r\\neloquent harangue, no single sentence of which was intelligible to them;\\r\\na series of witnesses proving to English auditors, beyond reach of\\r\\ndoubt, that the prisoner had deliberately murdered his wife; and finally\\r\\nthe judge instructing the jury, in language which was as insignificant\\r\\nto their minds as the same quantity of obsolete Law-French would have\\r\\nbeen, that it was their duty to return a verdict of \\'Guilty.\\' Throwing\\r\\nthemselves into the humor of the business, the Welsh jurymen, although\\r\\nthey were quite familiar with the facts of the case, acquitted the\\r\\nmurderer, much to the encouragement of many wretched Welsh husbands\\r\\nanxious for a termination of their matrimonial sufferings.\\r\\n\\r\\n[28] In the seventeenth century, lawyers usually called their clients\\r\\nand the non-legal public \\'Lay Gents.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTUDENT LIFE IN OLD TIME.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom statements made in previous chapters, it may be seen that in\\r\\nancient times the Law University was a far more conspicuous feature of\\r\\nthe metropolis than it has been in more modern generations. In the\\r\\nfifteenth century the law students of the town numbered about two\\r\\nthousand; in Elizabethan London their number fluctuated between one\\r\\nthousand and two thousand; towards the close of Charles II.\\'s reign they\\r\\nwere probably much less than fifteen hundred; in the middle of the\\r\\neighteenth century they do not seem to have much exceeded one thousand.\\r\\nThus at a time when the entire population of the capital was\\r\\nconsiderably less than the population of a third-rate provincial town of\\r\\nmodern England, the Inns of Court and Chancery contained more\\r\\nundergraduates than would be found on the books of the Oxford Colleges\\r\\nat the present time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry VIII.\\'s London looked to the University for mirth, news, trade.\\r\\nDuring vacations there was but little stir in the taverns and shops of\\r\\nFleet Street; haberdashers and vintners sate idle; musicians starved;\\r\\nand the streets of the capital were comparatively empty when the\\r\\nstudents had withdrawn to spend their holidays in the country. As soon\\r\\nas the gentlemen of the robe returned to town all was brisk and merry\\r\\nagain. As the town grew in extent and population, the social influence\\r\\nof the university gradually decreased; but in Elizabethan London the\\r\\n_éclat_ of the inns was at its brightest, and during the reigns of\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s two nearest successors London submitted to the Inns-of-Court\\r\\nmen as arbiters of all matters pertaining to taste--copying their dress,\\r\\nslang, amusements, and vices. The same may be said, with less emphasis,\\r\\nof Charles II.\\'s London. Under the \\'Merry Monarch\\' theatrical managers\\r\\nwere especially anxious to please the inns, for they knew that no play\\r\\nwould succeed which the lawyers had resolved to damn--that no actor\\r\\ncould achieve popularity if the gallants of the Temple combined to laugh\\r\\nhim down--that no company of performers could retain public favor when\\r\\nthey had lost the countenance of law-colleges. Something of this power\\r\\nthe young lawyers retained beyond the middle of the last century.\\r\\nFielding and Addison caught with nervous eagerness the critical gossip\\r\\nof the Temple and Chancery Lane, just as Congreve and Wycherly, Dryden\\r\\nand Cowley had caught it in previous generations. Fashionable tradesmen\\r\\nand caterers for the amusement of the public made their engagements and\\r\\nspeculations with reference to the opening of term. New plays, new\\r\\nbooks, new toys were never offered for the first time to London\\r\\npurchasers when the lawyers were away. All that the \\'season\\' is to\\r\\nmodern London, the \\'term\\' was to old London, from the accession of Henry\\r\\nVIII. to the death of George II., and many of the existing commercial\\r\\nand fashionable arrangements of a London \\'season\\' maybe traced to the\\r\\nold-world \\'term.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn olden time the influence of the law-colleges was as great upon\\r\\npolitics as upon fashion. Sheltering members of every powerful family in\\r\\nthe country they were centres of political agitation, and places for the\\r\\nsecret discussion of public affairs. Whatever plot was in course of\\r\\nincubation, the inns invariably harbored persons who were cognisant of\\r\\nthe conspiracy. When faction decided on open rebellion or hidden\\r\\ntreason, the agents of the malcontent leaders gathered together in the\\r\\ninns, where, so long as they did not rouse the suspicions of the\\r\\nauthorities and maintained the bearing of studious men, they could hire\\r\\nassassins, plan risings, hold interviews with fellow-conspirators, and\\r\\nnurse their nefarious projects into achievement. At periods of danger\\r\\ntherefore spies were set to watch the gates of the hostels, and mark who\\r\\nentered them. Governments took great pains to ascertain the secret life\\r\\nof the collegians. A succession of royal directions for the discipline\\r\\nof the inns under the Tudors and Stuarts points to the jealousy and\\r\\nconstant apprehensions with which the sovereigns of England long\\r\\nregarded those convenient lurking-places for restless spirits and\\r\\ndangerous adversaries. Just as the Student-quarter of Paris is still\\r\\nwatched by a vigilant police, so the Inns of Court were closely watched\\r\\nby the agents of Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell, of Burleigh and Buckingham.\\r\\nDuring the troubles and contentions of Elizabeth\\'s reign Lord Burleigh\\r\\nwas regularly informed concerning the life of the inns, the number of\\r\\nstudents in and out of town, the parentage and demeanor of new members,\\r\\nthe gossip of the halls, and the rumors of the cloisters. In proportion\\r\\nas the political temper and action of the lawyers were deemed matters of\\r\\nhigh importance, their political indiscretions and misdemeanors were\\r\\npromptly and sometimes ferociously punished. An idle joke over a pot of\\r\\nwine sometimes cost a witty barrister his social rank and his ears. To\\r\\npromote a wholesome fear of authority in the colleges, government every\\r\\nnow and then flogged a student at the cart\\'s tail in Holborn, or\\r\\npilloried a sad apprentice of the law in Chancery Lane, or hung an\\r\\nancient on a gibbet at the entrance of his inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anecdote-books abound with good stories that illustrate the\\r\\npolitical excitability of the inns in past times, and the energy with\\r\\nwhich ministers were wont to repress the first manifestations of\\r\\ninsubordination. Rushworth records the adventure of four young men of\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn who throw aside prudence and sobriety in a tavern hard by\\r\\ntheir inn, and drank to \"the confusion of the Archbishop of Canterbury.\"\\r\\nThe next day, full of penitence and head-ache, the offenders were\\r\\nbrought before the council, and called to account for their scandalous\\r\\nconduct; when they would have fared ill had not the Earl of Dorset done\\r\\nthem good service, and privately instructed them to say in their\\r\\ndefence, that they had not drunk confusion to the archbishop but to the\\r\\narchbishop\\'s _foes_. On this ingenious representation, the council\\r\\nsupposed that the drawer--on whose information the proceedings were\\r\\ntaken--had failed to catch the last word of the toast; and consequently\\r\\nthe young gentlemen were dismissed with a \\'light admonition,\\' much to\\r\\ntheir own surprise and the informer\\'s chagrin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the political explosiveness of the inns in Charles II.\\'s time\\r\\nNarcissus Luttrell gives the following illustration in his diary, under\\r\\ndate June 15 and 16, 1681:--\"The 15th was a project sett on foot in\\r\\nGrayes Inn for the carrying on an addresse for thankes to his majestie\\r\\nfor his late declaration; and was moved that day in the hall by some at\\r\\ndinner, and being (as is usual) sent to the barre messe to be by them\\r\\nrecommended to the bench, but was rejected both by bench and barr; but\\r\\nthe other side seeing they could doe no good this way, they gott about\\r\\nforty together and went to the tavern, and there subscribed the said\\r\\naddresse in the name of the truelye loyall gentlemen of Grayes Inn. The\\r\\nchief sticklers for the said addition were Sir William Seroggs, Jun.,\\r\\nRobert Fairebeard, Capt. Stowe, Capt. Radcliffe, one Yalden, with\\r\\nothers, to the number of 40 or thereabouts; many of them sharpers about\\r\\ntown, with clerks not out of their time, and young men newly come from\\r\\nthe university. And some of them went the 17th to Windsor, and presented\\r\\nthe said addresse to his majesty: who was pleasd to give them his\\r\\nthanks and confer (it is said) knighthood on the said Mr. Fairebeard;\\r\\nthis proves a mistake since. The 16th was much such another addresse\\r\\ncarried on in the Middle Temple, where several Templars, meeting about\\r\\none or two that afternoon in the hall for that purpose, they began to\\r\\ndebate it, but they were opposed till the hall began to fill; and then\\r\\nthe addressers called for Mr. Montague to take the chaire; on which a\\r\\npoll was demanded, but the addressers refused it, and carried Mr.\\r\\nMontague and sett him in the chaire, and the other part pulled him out,\\r\\non which high words grew, and some blows were given; but the addressers\\r\\nseeing they could doe no good with it in the hall, adjourned to the\\r\\nDivill Tavern, and there signed the addresse; the other party kept in\\r\\nthe hall, and fell to protesting against such illegall and arbitrary\\r\\nproceedings, subscribing their names to a greater number than the\\r\\naddressers were, and presented the same to the bench as a grievance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the King\\'s Head Tavern, which stood in Chancery Lane, the Devil\\r\\nTavern, in Fleet Street, was a favorite house with the Caroline Lawyers.\\r\\nIts proximity to the Temple secured the special patronage of the\\r\\ntemplars, whereas the King\\'s Head was more frequented by Lincoln\\'s-Inn\\r\\nmen; and in the tavern-haunting days of the seventeenth century those\\r\\ntwo places of entertainment saw many a wild and dissolute scene. Unlike\\r\\nChattelin, who endeavored to satisfy his guests with delicate repasts\\r\\nand light wines, the hosts of the Devil and the King\\'s Head provided the\\r\\nmore substantial fare of old England, and laid themselves out to please\\r\\nroysterers who liked pots of ale in the morning, and were wont to drink\\r\\nbrandy by the pint as the clocks struck midnight. Nando\\'s, the house\\r\\nwhere Thurlow in his student-period used to hold nightly disputations\\r\\nwith all comers of suitable social rank, was an orderly place in\\r\\ncomparison with these more venerable hostelries; and though the Mitre,\\r\\nCock, and Rainbow have witnessed a good deal of deep drinking, it may be\\r\\nquestioned if they, or any other ancient taverns of the legal quarter,\\r\\nencouraged a more boisterous and reckless revelry than that which\\r\\nconstituted the ordinary course of business at the King\\'s Head and the\\r\\nDevil.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his notes for Jan. 1681-2, Mr. Narcissus Luttrell observes--\"The\\r\\n13th, at night, some young gentlemen of the Temple went to the King\\'s\\r\\nHead Tavern, Chancery Lane, committing strange outrages there, breaking\\r\\nwindowes, &c., which the watch hearing of came to disperse them; but\\r\\nthey sending for severall of the watermen with halberts that attend\\r\\ntheir comptroller of the revells, were engaged in a desperate riott, in\\r\\nwhich one of the watchmen was run into the body and lies very ill; but\\r\\nthe watchmen secured one or two of the watermen.\" Eleven years later the\\r\\ndiarist records: \"Jan. 5. One Batsill, a young gentleman of the Temple,\\r\\nwas committed to Newgate for wounding a captain at the Devil Tavern in\\r\\nFleet Street on Saturday last.\" Such ebullitions of manly\\r\\nspirit--ebullitions pleasant enough to the humorist, but occasionally\\r\\nproductive of very disagreeable and embarrassing consequences--were not\\r\\nuncommon in the neighborhood of the Inns of Court whilst the Christmas\\r\\nrevels were in progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tempestuous, hot-blooded, irascible set were these gentlemen of the\\r\\nlaw-colleges, more zealous for their own honor than careful for the\\r\\nfeelings of their neighbors. Alternately warring with sharp tongues,\\r\\nsharp pens, and sharp swords they went on losing their tempers, friends,\\r\\nand lives in the most gallant and picturesque manner imaginable. Here is\\r\\na nice little row which occurred in the Middle Temple Hall during the\\r\\ndays of good Queen Bess! \"The records of the society,\" says Mr. Foss,\\r\\n\"preserve an account of the expulsion of a member, which is rendered\\r\\npeculiarly interesting in consequence of the eminence to which the\\r\\ndelinquent afterwards attained as a statesman, a poet, and a lawyer.\\r\\nWhilst the masters of the bench and other members of the society were\\r\\nsitting quietly at dinner on February 9, 1597-8, John Davis came into\\r\\nthe hall with his hat on his head, and attended by two persons armed\\r\\nwith swords, and going up to the barrister\\'s table, where Richard Martin\\r\\nwas sitting, he pulled out from under his gown a cudgel \\'quem vulgariter\\r\\nvocant a bastinado,\\' and struck him over the head repeatedly, and with\\r\\nso much violence that the bastinado was shivered into many pieces. Then\\r\\nretiring to the bottom of the hall, he drew one of his attendants\\'\\r\\nswords and flourished it over his head, turning his face towards Martin,\\r\\nand then turning away down the water steps of the Temple, threw himself\\r\\ninto a boat. For this outrageous act he was immediately disbarred and\\r\\nexpelled the house, and deprived for ever of all authority to speak or\\r\\nconsult in law. After nearly four years\\' retirement he petitioned the\\r\\nbenchers for his restoration, which they accorded on October 30, 1601,\\r\\nupon his making a public submission in the hall, and asking pardon of\\r\\nMr. Martin, who at once generously forgave him.\" Both the principals in\\r\\nthis scandalous outbreak and subsequent reconciliation became honorably\\r\\nknown in their profession--Martin rising to be a Recorder of London and\\r\\na member of parliament; and Davies acting as Attorney General of Ireland\\r\\nand Speaker of the Irish parliament, and achieving such a status in\\r\\npolitics and law that he was appointed to the Chief Justiceship of\\r\\nEngland, an office, however, which sudden death prevented him from\\r\\nfilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor must it be imagined that gay manners and lax morals were less\\r\\ngeneral amongst the veterans than amongst the youngsters of the bar.\\r\\nJudges and sergeants were quite as prone to levity and godless riot as\\r\\nstudents about to be called; and such was the freedom permitted by\\r\\nprofessional decorum that leading advocates habitually met their clients\\r\\nin taverns, and having talked themselves dry at the bars of Westminster\\r\\nHall, drank themselves speechless at the bars of Strand taverns--ere\\r\\nthey reeled again into their chambers. The same habits of uproarious\\r\\nself-indulgence were in vogue with the benchers of the inns, and the\\r\\nDoctors of Doctors\\' Commons. Hale\\'s austerity was the exceptional\\r\\ndemeanor of a pious man protesting against the wickedness of an impious\\r\\nage. Had it not been for the shortness of time that had elapsed since\\r\\nAlgernon Sidney\\'s trial and sentence, John Evelyn would have seen no\\r\\nreason for censuring the loud hilarity and drunkenness of Jeffreys and\\r\\nWithings at Mrs. Castle\\'s wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some respects, however, the social atmosphere of the inns was far\\r\\nmore wholesome in the days of Elizabeth, and for the hundred years\\r\\nfollowing her reign, than it is at present. Sprung in most cases from\\r\\nlegal families, the students who were educated to be working members of\\r\\nthe bar lived much more under the observation of their older relations,\\r\\nand in closer intercourse with their mothers and sisters than they do at\\r\\npresent. Now-a-days young Templars, fresh from the universities, would\\r\\nbe uneasy and irritable under strict domestic control; and as men with\\r\\nbeards and five-and-twenty years\\' knowledge of the world, they would\\r\\nresent any attempt to draw them within the lines of domestic control.\\r\\nBut in Elizabethan and also in Stuart London, law-students were\\r\\nconsiderably younger than they are under Victoria.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, the usage of the period trained young men to submit with\\r\\ncheerfulness to a parental discipline that would be deemed intolerable\\r\\nby our own youngsters. During the first terms of their eight, seven, or\\r\\nat least six years of pupilage, until they could secure quarters within\\r\\ncollege walls, students frequently lodged in the houses or chambers of\\r\\nnear relations who were established in the immediate vicinity of the\\r\\ninns. A judge with a house in Fleet Street, an eminent counsel with a\\r\\nfamily mansion in Holborn, or an office-holder with commodious chambers\\r\\nin Chancery Lane, usually numbered amongst the members of his family a\\r\\nson, or nephew, or cousin who was keeping terms for the bar. Thus placed\\r\\nunder the immediate superintendence of an elder whom he regarded with\\r\\naffection and pride, and surrounded by the wholesome interests of a\\r\\nrefined domestic circle, the raw student was preserved from much folly\\r\\nand ill-doing into which he would have fallen had he been thrown\\r\\nentirely on his own resources for amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pecuniary means of Inns-of-Court students have not varied much\\r\\nthroughout the last twelve generations. In days when money was scarce\\r\\nand very precious they of course lived on a smaller number of coins than\\r\\nthey require in these days when gold and silver are comparatively\\r\\nabundant and cheap; but it is reasonable to suppose that in every period\\r\\nthe allowances, on which the less affluent of them subsisted, represent\\r\\nthe amounts on which young men of their respective times were just able\\r\\nto maintain the figure and style of independent gentlemen. The costly\\r\\npageants and feasts of the inns in old days must not be taken as\\r\\nindicative of the pecuniary resources of the common run of students; for\\r\\nthe splendor of those entertainments was mainly due to the munificence\\r\\nof those more wealthy members who by a liberal and even profuse\\r\\nexpenditure purchased a right to control the diversions of the colleges.\\r\\nFortescue, speaking of his own time, says: \"There can no student bee\\r\\nmayntayned for lesse expenses by the yeare than twentye markes. And if\\r\\nhee haue a seruant to waite uppon him, as most of them haue, then so\\r\\nmuch the greater will his charges bee.\" Hence it appears that during the\\r\\nmost patrician period of the law university, when wealthy persons were\\r\\naccustomed to maintain ostentatious retinues of servants, a law-student\\r\\noften had no private personal attendant. An ordinance shows that in\\r\\nElizabethan London the Inns-of-Court men were waited upon by laundresses\\r\\nor bedmakers who served and took wages from several masters at the same\\r\\ntime. It would be interesting to ascertain the exact time when the\\r\\n\"laundress\" was first introduced into the Temple. She certainly\\r\\nflourished in the days of Queen Bess; and Roger North\\'s piquant\\r\\ndescription of his brother\\'s laundress is applicable to many of her\\r\\nsuccessors who are looking after their perquisites at the present date.\\r\\n\"The housekeeper,\" says Roger, \"had been formerly his lordship\\'s\\r\\nlaundress at the Temple, and knew well her master\\'s brother so early as\\r\\nwhen he was at the writing-school. She _was a phthisical old woman, and\\r\\ncould scarce crawl upstairs once a day_.\" This general employment of\\r\\nservants who were common to several masters would alone prove that the\\r\\nInns-of-Court men in the seventeenth century felt it convenient to\\r\\nhusband their resources, and exercise economy. Throughout that century\\r\\nsixty pounds was deemed a sufficient income for a Temple student; and\\r\\nthough it was a scant allowance, some young fellows managed to push on\\r\\nwith a still more modest revenue. Simonds D\\'Ewes had £60 per annum\\r\\nduring his student course, and £100 a year on becoming an\\r\\nutter-barrister. \"It pleased God also in mercy,\" he writes, \"after this\\r\\nto ease me of that continual want or short stipend I had for about five\\r\\nyears last past groaned under; for my father, immediately on my call to\\r\\nthe bar, enlarged my former allowance with forty pounds more annually;\\r\\nso as, after this plentiful annuity of one hundred pounds was duly and\\r\\nquarterly paid me by him, I found myself easyd of so many cares and\\r\\ndiscontents as I may well account that the 27th day of June foregoing\\r\\nthe first day of my outward happiness since the decease of my dearest\\r\\nmother.\" All things considered, a bachelor in James I.\\'s London with a\\r\\nclear income of £100 per annum was on the whole as well off for his time\\r\\nas a young barrister of the present day would be with an annual\\r\\nallowance of £250 or £300. Francis North, when a student, was allowed\\r\\nonly £60 per annum; and as soon as he was called and began to earn a\\r\\nlittle money, his parsimonious father reduced the stipend by £10; but,\\r\\nadds Roger North, \"to do right to his good father, he paid him that\\r\\nfifty pounds a year as long as he lived, saying he would not discourage\\r\\nindustry by rewarding it, when successful, with less.\" George Jeffreys,\\r\\nin his student-days, smarted under a still more galling penury, for he\\r\\nwas allowed only £50 a year, £10 being for his clothes, and £40 for the\\r\\nrest of his expenditure. In the following century the nominal incomes of\\r\\nlaw-students rose in proportion as the wealth of the country increased\\r\\nand the currency fell in value. In George II.\\'s time a young Templar\\r\\nexpected his father to allow him £150 a year, and on encouragement would\\r\\nspend twice that amount in the same time. Henry Fielding\\'s allowance\\r\\nfrom General Fielding was £200 per annum; but as he said, with a laugh,\\r\\nhe had too feeling and dutiful a nature to press an affectionate father\\r\\nfor money which he was totally unable to pay. At the present time £150\\r\\nper annum is about the smallest sum on which a law-student can live with\\r\\noutward decency; and £250 per annum the lowest amount on which a chamber\\r\\nbarrister can live with suitable dignity and comfort. If he has to\\r\\nmaintain the expenses of a distant circuit Mr. Briefless requires from\\r\\n£100 to £200 more. Alas! how many of Mr. Briefless\\'s meritorious and\\r\\nmost ornamental kind are compelled to shift on far less ample means!\\r\\nHow many of them periodically repeat the jest of poor A----, who made\\r\\nthis brief and suggestive official return to the Income Tax\\r\\nCommissioners--\"I am totally dependent on my father, who allows\\r\\nme--nothing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nREADERS AND MOOTMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomantic eulogists of the Inns of Court maintain that, as an instrument\\r\\nof education, the law-university was nearly perfect for many generations\\r\\nafter its consolidation. That in modern time abuses have impaired its\\r\\nfaculties and diminished its usefulness they admit. Some of them are\\r\\ncandid enough to allow that, as a school for the systematic study of\\r\\nlaw, it is under existing circumstances a deplorably deficient machine;\\r\\nbut they unite in declaring that there _was_ a time when the system of\\r\\nthe combined Colleges was complete and thoroughly efficacious. The more\\r\\ncautious of these eulogists decline to state the exact limits of the\\r\\nperiod when the actual condition of the university merited their cordial\\r\\napproval, but they concur in pointing to the years between the accession\\r\\nof Henry VII. and the death of James I., as comprising the brightest\\r\\ndays of its academical vigor and renown.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is however worthy of observation that throughout the times when the\\r\\nlegal learning and discipline of the colleges are described to have been\\r\\nadmirable, the system and the students by no means won the approbation\\r\\nof those critical authorities who were best able to see their failings\\r\\nand merits. Wolsey was so strongly impressed by the faulty education of\\r\\nthe barristers who practised before him, and more especially by their\\r\\ntotal ignorance of the principles of jurisprudence, that he prepared a\\r\\nplan for a new university which should be established in London, and\\r\\nshould impart a liberal and exact knowledge of law. Had he lived to\\r\\ncarry out his scheme it is most probable that the Inns of Court and\\r\\nChancery would have become subsidiary and subordinate establishments to\\r\\nthe new foundation. In this matter, sympathizing with the more\\r\\nenlightened minds of his age, Sir Nicholas Bacon was no less desirous\\r\\nthan the great cardinal that a new law university should be planted in\\r\\ntown, and he urged on Henry VIII. the propriety of devoting a certain\\r\\nportion of the confiscated church property to the foundation and\\r\\nendowment of such an institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn paper the scheme of the old exercises and degrees looks very\\r\\nimposing, and those who delight in painting fancy pictures may infer\\r\\nfrom them that the scholastic order of the colleges was perfect. Before\\r\\na young man could be called to the bar, he had under ordinary\\r\\ncircumstances to spend seven or eight years in arguing cases at the Inns\\r\\nof Chancery, in proving his knowledge of law and Law-French at moots, in\\r\\nsharpening his wits at case-putting, in patient study of the Year-Books,\\r\\nand in watching the trials of Westminster Hall. After his call he was\\r\\nrequired to spend another period in study and academic exercise before\\r\\nhe presumed to raise his voice at the bar; and in his progress to the\\r\\nhighest rank of his profession he was expected to labor in educating the\\r\\nstudents of his house as assistant-reader, single-reader, double-reader.\\r\\nThe gravest lawyers of every inn were bound to aid in the task of\\r\\nteaching the mysteries of the law to the rising generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old ordinances assumed that the law-student was thirsting for a\\r\\nknowledge of law, and that the veterans were no less eager to impart\\r\\nit. During term law was talked in hall at dinner and supper, and after\\r\\nthese meals the collegians argued points. \"The cases were put\" after the\\r\\nearlier repast, and twice or thrice a week moots were \"brought in\" after\\r\\nthe later meal. The students were also encouraged to assemble towards\\r\\nthe close of each day and practise \\'case-putting\\' in their gardens and\\r\\nin the cloisters of the Temple or Lincoln\\'s Inn. The \\'great fire\\' of\\r\\n1678-9 having destroyed the Temple Cloisters, some of the benchers\\r\\nproposed to erect chambers on the ground, to and fro upon which\\r\\nlaw-students had for generations walked whilst they wrangled aloud; but\\r\\nthe Earl of Nottingham, recalling the days when young Heneage Finch used\\r\\nto put cases with his contemporary students, strangled the proposal at\\r\\nits birth, and Sir Christopher Wren subsequently built the Cloisters\\r\\nwhich may be seen at the present day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is reason to fear that at a very early period in their history\\r\\nthe Inns of Court began to pay more attention to certain outward forms\\r\\nof instruction than to instruction itself. The unbiassed inquirer is\\r\\ndriven to suspect that \\'case-putting\\' soon became an idle ceremony, and\\r\\n\\'mooting\\' a mere pastime. Gentlemen ate heartily in the sixteenth and\\r\\nseventeenth centuries; and it is not easy to believe that immediately\\r\\nafter a twelve o\\'clock dinner benchers were in the best possible mood to\\r\\nteach, or students in the fittest condition for learning. It is credible\\r\\nthat these post-prandial exercitations were often enlivened by sparkling\\r\\nquips and droll occurrences; but it is less easy to believe that they\\r\\nwere characterised by severe thought and logical exactness. So also with\\r\\nthe after-supper exercises. The six o\\'clock suppers of the lawyers were\\r\\nno light repasts, but hearty meals of meat and bread, washed down by\\r\\n\\'_green pots_\\' of ale and wine. When \\'the horn\\' sounded for supper, the\\r\\nstudent was in most cases better able to see the truth of knotty points\\r\\nthan when in compliance with etiquette he bowed to the benchers, and\\r\\nasked if it was their pleasure to hear a moot. It seems probable that\\r\\nlong before \\'case-puttings\\' and \\'mootings\\' were altogether disused, the\\r\\nold benchers were wont to wink mischievously at each other when they\\r\\nprepared to teach the boys, and that sometimes they would turn away from\\r\\nthe proceedings of a moot with an air of disdain or indifference. The\\r\\ninquirer is not induced to rate more highly the intellectual effort of\\r\\nsuch exercises because the teachers refreshed their exhausted powers\\r\\nwith bread and beer as soon as the arguments were closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen such men as Coke and Francis Bacon were the readers, the students\\r\\nwere entertained with lectures of surpassing excellence; but it was\\r\\nseldom that such readers could be found. It seems also that at an early\\r\\nperiod men became readers, not because they had any especial aptitude\\r\\nfor offices of instruction, or because they had some especial fund of\\r\\ninformation--but simply because it was their turn to read. Routine\\r\\nplaced them in the pulpit for a certain number of weeks; and when they\\r\\nhad done all that routine required of them, and had thereby qualified\\r\\nthemselves for promotion to the rank of sergeant, they took their seats\\r\\namongst the benchers and ancients with the resolution not to trouble\\r\\nthemselves again about the intellectual progress of the boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon also the chief teacher of an Inn of Court became its chief feaster\\r\\nand principal entertainer; and in like manner his subordinates in\\r\\noffice, such as assistant readers and readers elect, were required to\\r\\nput their hands into their pockets, and feed their pupils with venison\\r\\nand wine as well as with law and equity. It is amusing to observe how\\r\\nlittle Dugdale has to say about the professional duties of readers--and\\r\\nhow much about their hospitable functions and responsibilities. Philip\\r\\nand Mary ordered that no reader of the Middle Temple should give away\\r\\nmore than fifteen bucks during his readings; but so greatly did the cost\\r\\nof readers\\' entertainments increase in the following century, that\\r\\nDugdale observes--\"But the times are altered; there being few summer\\r\\nreaders who, in half the time that heretofore a reading was wont to\\r\\ncontinue, spent so little as threescore bucks, besides red deer; some\\r\\nhave spent fourscore, some an hundred.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as readers were required to spend more in hospitality, they were\\r\\nrequired to display less learning. Sound lawyers avoided election to the\\r\\nreaders\\' chairs, leaving them to be filled by rich men who could afford\\r\\nto feast the nobility and gentry, or at least by men who were willing to\\r\\npurchase social _éclat_ with a lavish outlay of money. Under Charles II.\\r\\nthe \\'readings\\' were too often nothing better than scandalous exhibitions\\r\\nof mental incapacity: and having sunk into disrepute, they died out\\r\\nbefore the accession of James II.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scandalous and beastly disorder of the Grand Day Feasts at the\\r\\nMiddle Temple, during Francis North\\'s tenure of the reader\\'s office, was\\r\\none of the causes that led to the discontinuance of Reader\\'s Banquets at\\r\\nthat house; and the other inns gladly followed the example of the Middle\\r\\nTemple in putting an end to a custom which had ceased to promote the\\r\\ndignity of the law. Of this feast, and his brother\\'s part in it, Roger\\r\\nNorth says: \"He (_i.e._ Francis North) sent out the officers with white\\r\\nstaves (for so the way was) and a long list to invite; but he went\\r\\nhimself to wait upon the Archbishop of Canterbury, Sheldon; for so also\\r\\nthe ceremony required. The archbishop received him very honorably and\\r\\nwould not part with him at the stairshead, as usually had been done;\\r\\nbut, telling him he was no ordinary reader, went down, and did not part\\r\\ntill he saw him past at his outward gate I cannot much commend the\\r\\nextravagance of the feasting used at these readings; and that of his\\r\\nlordship\\'s was so terrible an example, that I think none hath ventured\\r\\nsince to read publicly; but the exercise is turned into a revenue, and a\\r\\ncomposition is paid into the treasury of the society. Therefore one may\\r\\nsay, as was said of Cleomenes, that, in this respect, his lordship was\\r\\n_ultimus herorum_, the last of the heroes. And the profusion of the best\\r\\nprovisions, and wine, was to the worst of purposes--debauchery,\\r\\ndisorder, tumult, and waste. I will give but one instance; upon the\\r\\ngrand day, as it was called, a banquet was provided to be set upon the\\r\\ntable, composed of pyramids, and smaller services in form. The first\\r\\npyramid was at least four feet high, with stages one above another. The\\r\\nconveying this up to the table, through a crowd, that were in full\\r\\npurpose to overturn it, was no small work: but, with the friendly\\r\\nassistance of the gentlemen, it was set whole upon the table. But, after\\r\\nit was looked upon a little, all went, hand over hand, among the rout in\\r\\nthe hall, and for the most part was trod under foot. The entertainment\\r\\nthe nobility had out of this was, after they had tossed away the dishes,\\r\\na view of the crowd in confusion, wallowing one over another, and\\r\\ncontending for a dirty share of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would, however, be unfair to the ancient exercises of \\'case-putting\\'\\r\\nand \\'mooting\\' not to bear in mind that by habituating successful\\r\\nbarristers to take personal interest in the professional capabilities of\\r\\nstudents, they helped to maintain a salutary intercourse betwixt the\\r\\nyounger and older members of the profession. So long as \\'moots\\' lasted,\\r\\nit was the fashion with eminent counsel to accost students in\\r\\nWestminster Hall, and gossip with them about legal matters. In Charles\\r\\nII.\\'s time, such eminent barristers as Sir Geoffrey Palmer daily gave\\r\\npractical hints and valuable suggestions to students who courted their\\r\\nfavor; find accurate legal scholars, such as old \\'Index Waller,\\' would,\\r\\nunder judicious treatment, exhibit their learning to boys ambitious of\\r\\nfollowing in their steps. Chief Justice Saunders, during the days of his\\r\\npre-eminence at the bar, never walked through Westminster Hall without a\\r\\ntrain of lads at his heels. \"I have seen him,\" says Roger North, \"for\\r\\nhours and half-hours together, before the court sat, stand at the bar,\\r\\nwith an audience of students over against him, putting of cases, and\\r\\ndebating so as suited their capacities, and encouraged their industry.\\r\\nAnd so in the Temple, he seldom moved without a parcel of youths hanging\\r\\nabout him, and he merry and jesting with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLong after \\'moots\\' had fallen into disuse, their influence in this\\r\\nrespect was visible in the readiness of wigged veterans to extend a\\r\\nkindly and useful patronage to students. Even so late as the close of\\r\\nthe last century, great black-letter lawyers used to accost students in\\r\\nWestminster Hall, and give them fair words, in a manner that would be\\r\\nmisunderstood in the present day. Sergeant Hill--whose reputation for\\r\\nrecondite legal erudition, resembled that of \\'_Index_ Waller,\\' or\\r\\nMaynard, in the seventeenth century--once accosted John Scott, as the\\r\\nlatter, in his student days, was crossing Westminster Hall. \"Pray, young\\r\\ngentleman,\" said the black-letter lawyer, \"do you think herbage and\\r\\npannage rateable to the poor\\'s rate?\" \"Sir,\" answered the future Lord\\r\\nEldon, with a courteous bow to the lawyer, whom he knew only by sight,\\r\\n\"I cannot presume to give any opinion, inexperienced and unlearned as I\\r\\nam, to a person of your great knowledge, and high character in the\\r\\nprofession.\" \"Upon my word,\" replied the sergeant, eyeing the young man\\r\\nwith unaffected delight, \"you are a pretty sensible young gentleman; I\\r\\ndon\\'t often meet with such. If I had asked Mr. Burgess, a young man upon\\r\\nour circuit, the question, he would have told me that I was an old\\r\\nfool. You are an extraordinary sensible young gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period when \\'readings,\\' \\'mooting,\\' and \\'case-putting\\' fell into\\r\\ndisuse or contempt, is known with sufficient accuracy. Having noticed\\r\\nthe decay of readings, Sir John Bramston writes, in Charles II.\\'s reign,\\r\\n\"At this tyme readings are totally in all the Inns of Court layd aside;\\r\\nand to speak truth, with great reason, for it was a step at once to the\\r\\ndignity of a sergeant, but not soe now.\" Marking the time when moots\\r\\nbecame farcical forms, Roger North having stated that his brother\\r\\nFrancis, when a student, was \"an attendant (as well as exerciser) at the\\r\\nordinary moots in the Middle Temple and at New Inn,\" goes on to say, \"In\\r\\nthose days, the moots were carefully performed, and it is hard to give a\\r\\ngood reason (bad ones are prompt enough) why they are not so now.\" But\\r\\nit should be observed, that though for all practical purposes \\'moots\\'\\r\\nand \\'case-puttings\\' ceased in Charles II.\\'s time, they were not formally\\r\\nabolished. Indeed, they lingered on throughout the eighteenth century,\\r\\nand to the present time--when vestiges of them may still be observed in\\r\\nthe usages and discipline of the Inns. Before the writer of this page\\r\\nwas called to the bar by the Masters of the Society of Lincoln\\'s Inn,\\r\\nhe, like all other students of his time, had to go through the form of\\r\\nputting a case on certain days in the hall after dinner. The ceremony\\r\\nappeared to him alike ludicrous and interesting. To put his case, he was\\r\\nconducted by the steward of the inn to the top of the senior bar table,\\r\\nwhen the steward placed an open MS. book before him, and said, \"Read\\r\\nthat, sir;\" whereupon this deponent read aloud something about \"a femme\\r\\nsole,\" or some such thing, and was still reading the rest of the MS.,\\r\\nkindly opened under his nose by the steward, when that worthy officer\\r\\nchecked him suddenly, saying, \"That will do, sir; you have _put_ your\\r\\ncase--and can sign the book.\" The book duly signed, this deponent bowed\\r\\nto the assembled barristers, and walked out of the hall, smiling as he\\r\\nthought how, by an ingenious fiction, he was credited with having put an\\r\\nelaborate case to a college of profound jurists, with having argued it\\r\\nbefore an attentive audience, and with having borne away the laurels of\\r\\ntriumph. Recently this pleasant mockery of case-putting has been swept\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Roger North\\'s \\'Discourse on the Study of the Laws,\\' and \\'Life of the\\r\\nLord Keeper Guildford,\\' the reader may see with clearness the course of\\r\\nan industrious law-student during the latter half of the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury, and it differs less from the ordinary career of an industrious\\r\\nTemple-student in our time, than many recent writers on the subject\\r\\nthink.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Charles II., James II., and William III. the law-student was\\r\\ncompelled to muster the barbarous Law-French; but the books which he was\\r\\nrequired to read were few in comparison with those of a modern\\r\\nInns-of-Court man. Roger North mentions between twenty and thirty\\r\\nauthors, which the student should read in addition to Year-Books and\\r\\nmore recent reports; and it is clear that the man who knew with any\\r\\ndegree of familiarity such a body of legal literature was a very erudite\\r\\nlawyer two hundred years since. But the student was advised to read this\\r\\nsmall library again and again, \"common-placing\" the contents of its\\r\\nvolumes, and also \"common-placing\" all new legal facts. The utility and\\r\\nconvenience of common-place books were more apparent two centuries\\r\\nsince, than in our time, when books of reference are always published\\r\\nwith good tables of contents and alphabetical indexes. Roger North held\\r\\nthat no man could become a good lawyer who did not keep a common-place\\r\\nbook. He instructs the student to buy for a common-place register \"a\\r\\ngood large paper book, as big as a church bible;\" he instructs him how\\r\\nto classify the facts which should be entered in the work; and for a\\r\\nmodel of a lucid and thoroughly lawyer-like common-place book he refers\\r\\n\"to Lincoln\\'s Inn library, where the Lord Hale\\'s common-place book is\\r\\nconserved, and that may be a pattern, _instar omnium_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUPILS IN CHAMBERS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the most important part of an industrious law-student\\'s labors in\\r\\nolden time, was the work of watching the practice of Westminster Hall.\\r\\nIn the seventeenth century, the constant succession of political trials\\r\\nmade the King\\'s Bench Court especially attractive to students who were\\r\\nmore eager for gossip than advancement of learning; but it was always\\r\\nheld that the student, who was desirous to learn the law rather than to\\r\\ncatch exciting news or hear exciting speeches, ought to frequent the\\r\\nCommon Pleas, in which court the common law was said to be at home. At\\r\\nthe Common Pleas, a student might find a seat vacant in the students\\'\\r\\nbenches so late as ten o\\'clock; but it was not unusual for every place\\r\\ndevoted to the accommodation of students in the Court of King\\'s Bench,\\r\\nto be occupied by six o\\'clock, A.M. By dawn, and even before the sun had\\r\\nbegun to break, students bent on getting good seats at the hearing of an\\r\\nimportant cause would assemble, and patiently wait in court till the\\r\\njudges made their appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne prominent feature in the advocate\\'s education must always be\\r\\nelocutionary practice. \"Talk; if you can, to the point, but anyhow\\r\\ntalk,\" has been the motto of Advocacy from time immemorial. Heneage\\r\\nFinch, who, like every member of his silver-tongued family, was an\\r\\nauthority on matters pertaining to eloquence, is said to have advised a\\r\\nyoung student \"to study all the morning and talk all the afternoon.\"\\r\\nSergeant Maynard used to express his opinion of the importance of\\r\\neloquence to a lawyer by calling law the \"ars bablativa.\" Roger North\\r\\nobserves--\"He whose trade is speaking must not, whatever comes out, fail\\r\\nto speak, for that is a fault in the main much worse than impertinence.\"\\r\\nAnd at a recent address to the students of the London University, Lord\\r\\nBrougham urged those of his auditors, who intended to adopt the\\r\\nprofession of the bar, to habituate themselves to talk about everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn past times law-students were proverbial for their talkativeness; and\\r\\nthough the present writer has never seen any records of a Carolinian\\r\\nlaw-debating society, it is matter of certainty that in the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury the young students and barristers formed themselves into\\r\\ncoteries, or clubs, for the practice of elocution and for legal\\r\\ndiscussions. The continual debates on \\'mootable days,\\' and the incessant\\r\\nwranglings of the Temple cloisters, encouraged them to pay especial\\r\\nattention to such exercises. In Charles II.\\'s reign Pool\\'s company, was\\r\\na coterie of students and young barristers, who used to meet\\r\\nperiodically for congenial conversation and debate. \"There is seldom a\\r\\ntime,\" says Roger North, speaking of this coterie, \"but in every Inn of\\r\\nCourt there is a studious, sober company that are select to each other,\\r\\nand keep company at meals and refreshments. Such a company did Mr. Pool\\r\\nfind out, whereof Sergeant Wild was one, and every one of them proved\\r\\neminent, and most of them are now preferred in the law; and Mr. Pool, at\\r\\nthe latter end of his life, took such a pride in his company that he\\r\\naffected to furnish his chambers with their pictures.\" Amongst the\\r\\nbenefits to be derived from such a club as that of which Mr. Pool was\\r\\npresident, Roger North mentions \"Aptness to speak;\" adding: \"for a man\\r\\nmay be possessed of a book-case, and think he has it _ad unguem_\\r\\nthroughout, and when he offers at it shall find himself at a loss, and\\r\\nhis words will not be right and proper, or perhaps too many, and his\\r\\nexpressions confused: _when he has once talked his case over, and, his\\r\\ncompany have tossed it a little to and fro, then he shall utter it more\\r\\nreadily, with fewer words and much more force_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words make it clear that Mr. Pool\\'s \\'company\\' was a select\\r\\n\\'law-debating society.\\' Far smaller as to number of members, something\\r\\nmore festive in its arrangements, but not less bent on furthering the\\r\\nprofessional progress of its members, it was, some two hundred years\\r\\nsince, all that the \\'Hardwicke\\' and other similar associations are at\\r\\nthe present.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such fraternities--of which the Inns of Court had several in the last\\r\\ncentury--Murray and Thurlow, Law and Erskine had recourse: and besides\\r\\nattending strictly professional clubs, it was usual for the students, of\\r\\ntheir respective times, to practise elocution at the coffee-houses and\\r\\npublic spouting-rooms of the town. Murray used to argue as well as\\r\\n\\'drink champagne\\' with the wits; Thurlow was the irrepressible talker of\\r\\nNando\\'s; Erskine used to carry his scarlet uniform from Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\nHall, to the smoke-laden atmosphere of Coachmakers\\' Hall, at which\\r\\nmemorable \\'discussion forum\\' Edward Law is known to have spoken in the\\r\\npresence of a closely packed assembly of politicians, idlers upon town,\\r\\nshop-men, and drunkards. Thither also Horne Tooke and Dunning used to\\r\\nadjourn after dining with Taffy Kenyon at the Chancery Lane\\r\\neating-house, where the three friends were wont to stay their hunger for\\r\\nsevenpence halfpenny each. \"Dunning and myself,\" Horne Tooke said\\r\\nboastfully, when he recalled these economical repasts, \"were generous,\\r\\nfor we gave the girl who waited on us a penny apiece; but Kenyon, who\\r\\nalways knew the value of money, rewarded her with a halfpenny, and\\r\\nsometimes with a _promise_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding the recent revival of lectures and the institution of\\r\\nexaminations, the actual course of the law-student has changed little\\r\\nsince the author of the \\'Pleader\\'s Guide,\\' in 1706, described the career\\r\\nof John Surrebutter, Esq., Special Pleader and Barrister-at-Law. The\\r\\nlabors of \\'pupils in chambers, are thus noticed by Mr. Surrebutter:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"And, better to improve your taste,\\r\\n   Are by your parents\\' fondness plac\\'d\\r\\n   Amongst the blest, the chosen few\\r\\n   (Blest, if their happiness they knew),\\r\\n   Who for three hundred guineas paid\\r\\n   To some great master of the trade,\\r\\n   Have at his rooms by _special_ favor\\r\\n   His leave to use their best endeavor,\\r\\n   By drawing pleas from nine till four,\\r\\n   To earn him twice three hundred more;\\r\\n   And after dinner may repair\\r\\n   To \\'foresaid rooms, and then and there\\r\\n   Have \\'foresaid leave from five till ten,\\r\\n   To draw th\\' aforesaid pleas again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nContinuing to describe his professional career, Mr. Surrebutter mentions\\r\\ncertain facts which show that so late as the close of last century\\r\\nprofessional etiquette did not forbid special pleaders and barristers to\\r\\ncurry favor with solicitors and solicitors\\' clerks by attentions which\\r\\nwould now-a-days be deemed reprehensible. He says:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Whoe\\'er has drawn a special plea\\r\\n   Has heard of old Tom Tewkesbury,\\r\\n   Deaf as a post, and thick as mustard,\\r\\n   He aim\\'d at wit, and bawl\\'d and bluster\\'d\\r\\n   And died a Nisi Prius leader--\\r\\n   That genius was my special pleader--\\r\\n   That great man\\'s office I attended,\\r\\n   By Hawk and Buzzard recommended\\r\\n   Attorneys both of wondrous skill,\\r\\n   To pluck the goose and drive the quill.\\r\\n   Three years I sat his smoky room in,\\r\\n   Pens, paper, ink, and pounce consuming;\\r\\n   The fourth, when Epsom Day begun,\\r\\n   Joyful I hailed th\\' auspicious sun,\\r\\n   Bade Tewkesbury and Clerk adieu;\\r\\n   (Purification, eighty-two)\\r\\n   Of both I wash\\'d my hands; and though\\r\\n   With nothing for my cash to show,\\r\\n   But precedents so scrawl\\'d and blurr\\'d,\\r\\n   I scarce could read a single word,\\r\\n   Nor in my books of common-place\\r\\n   One feature, of the law could trace,\\r\\n   Save Buzzard\\'s nose and visage thin,\\r\\n   And Hawk\\'s deficiency of chin,\\r\\n   Which I while lolling at my ease\\r\\n   Was wont to draw instead of pleas.\\r\\n   My chambers I equipt complete,\\r\\n   Made friends, hired books, and gave to eat;\\r\\n   If haply to regale my friends on,\\r\\n   My mother sent a haunch of ven\\'son,\\r\\n   I most respectfully entreated\\r\\n   The choicest company to eat it;\\r\\n   _To wit_, old Buzzard, Hawk, and Crow;\\r\\n   _Item_, Tom Thornback, Shark, and Co.\\r\\n   Attorneys all as keen and staunch\\r\\n   As e\\'er devoured a client\\'s haunch.\\r\\n   And did I not their clerks invite\\r\\n   To taste said ven\\'son hash\\'d at night?\\r\\n   For well I knew that hopeful fry\\r\\n   My rising merit would descry,\\r\\n   The same litigious course pursue,\\r\\n   And when to fish of prey they grew,\\r\\n   By love of food and contest led,\\r\\n   Would haunt the spot where once they fed.\\r\\n   Thus having with due circumspection\\r\\n   Formed my professional connexion,\\r\\n   My desks with precedents I strew\\'d,\\r\\n   Turned critic, danc\\'d, or penn\\'d an ode,\\r\\n   Suited the _ton_, became a free\\r\\n   And easy man of gallantry;\\r\\n   But if while capering at my glass,\\r\\n   Or toying with a favorite lass,\\r\\n   I heard the aforesaid Hawk a-coming,\\r\\n   Or Buzzard on the staircase humming,\\r\\n   At once the fair angelic maid\\r\\n   Into my coal-hole I convey\\'d;\\r\\n   At once with serious look profound,\\r\\n   Mine eyes commencing with the ground,\\r\\n   I seem\\'d like one estranged to sleep,\\r\\n   \\'And fixed in cogitation deep,\\'\\r\\n   Sat motionless, and in my hand I\\r\\n   Held my \\'Doctrina Placitandi,\\'\\r\\n   And though I never read a page in\\'t,\\r\\n   Thanks to that shrewd, well-judging agent,\\r\\n   My sister\\'s husband, Mr. Shark,\\r\\n   Soon got six pupils and a clerk.\\r\\n   Five pupils were my stint, the other\\r\\n   I took to compliment his mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving fleeced pupils, and worked as a special pleader for a time, Mr.\\r\\nSurrebutter is called to the bar; after which ceremony his action\\r\\ntowards \\'the inferior branch\\' of the profession is not more dignified\\r\\nthan it was whilst he practised as a Special Pleader.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears that in Mr. Surrebutter\\'s time (_circa_ 1780) it was usual\\r\\nfor a student to spend three whole years in the same pleader\\'s chambers,\\r\\npaying three hundred guineas for the course of study. Not many years\\r\\npassed before students saw it was not to their advantage to spend so\\r\\nlong a period with the same instructor, and by the end of the century\\r\\nthe industrious student who could command the fees wherewith to pay for\\r\\nsuch special tuition, usually spent a year or two in a pleader\\'s\\r\\nchambers, and another year or two in the chambers of an equity\\r\\ndraughtsman, or conveyancer. Lord Campbell, at the opening of the\\r\\npresent century, spent three years in the chambers of the eminent\\r\\nSpecial Pleader, Mr. Tidd, of whose learning and generosity the\\r\\nbiographer of the Chancellors makes cordial and grateful acknowledgment.\\r\\nFinding that Campbell could not afford to pay a second hundred guineas\\r\\nfor a second year\\'s instruction, Tidd not only offered him the run of\\r\\nhis chambers without payment, but made the young Scotchman take back the\\r\\n£105 which he had paid for the first twelve months.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his later years Lord Campbell delighted to trace his legal pedigree\\r\\nto the great pleader and \\'pupillizer\\' of the last century, Tom Warren.\\r\\nThe chart ran thus: \"Tom Warren had for pupil Sergeant Runnington, who\\r\\ninstructed in the mysteries of special pleading the learned Tidd, who\\r\\nwas the teacher of John Campbell.\" With honest pride and pleasant vanity\\r\\nthe literary Chancellor maintained that he had given the genealogical\\r\\ntree another generation of forensic honor, as Solicitor General Dundas\\r\\nand Vaughan Williams, of the Common Pleas Bench, were his pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Campbell speaks of _Tom Warren_ as \"the greater founder of the\\r\\nspecial pleading race,\" and maintains that \"the voluntary discipline of\\r\\nthe special pleader\\'s office\" was unknown before the middle of the last\\r\\ncentury, it is certain that the voluntary discipline of a legal\\r\\ninstructor\\'s office or chambers was an affair of frequent occurrence\\r\\nlong before Warren\\'s rise. Roger North, in his \\'Discourse on the Study\\r\\nof the Laws,\\' makes no allusion to any such voluntary discipline as an\\r\\nordinary feature of a law-student\\'s career; but in his \\'Life of Lord\\r\\nKeeper Guildford\\' he expressly informs us that he was a pupil in his\\r\\nbrother\\'s chambers. \"His lordship,\" writes the biographer, \"having taken\\r\\nthat advanced post, and designing to benefit a relation (the Honorable\\r\\nRoger North), who was a student in the law, and kept him company, caused\\r\\nhis clerk to put into his hands all his draughts, such as he himself had\\r\\ncorrected, and after which conveyances had been engrossed, that, by a\\r\\nperusal of them, he might get some light into the formal skill of\\r\\nconveyancing. And that young gentleman instantly went to work, and first\\r\\nnumbered the draughts, and then made an index of all the clauses,\\r\\nreferring to that number and folio; so that, in this strict perusal and\\r\\ndigestion of the various matters, he acquired, not only a formal style,\\r\\nbut also apt precedents, and a competent notion of instruments of all\\r\\nkinds. And to this great condescension was owing that little progress he\\r\\nmade, which afterwards served to prepare some matters for his lordship\\'s\\r\\nown perusal and settlement.\" Here then is a case of a pupil in a\\r\\nbarrister\\'s chambers in Charles II.\\'s reign; and it is a case that\\r\\nsuffers nothing from the fact that the teacher took no fee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn like manner, John Trevor (subsequently Master of the Rolls and\\r\\nSpeaker of the Commons) about the same time was \"bred a sort of clerk in\\r\\nold Arthur Trevor\\'s chamber, an eminent and worthy professor of the law\\r\\nin the Inner Temple.\" On being asked what might be the name of the boy\\r\\nwith such a hideous squint who sate at a clerk\\'s desk in the outer room,\\r\\nArthur Trevor answered, \"A kinsman of mine that I have allowed to sit\\r\\nhere, to learn the knavish part of the law.\" It must be observed that\\r\\nJohn Trevor was not a clerk, but merely a \"sort of a clerk\" in his\\r\\nkinsman\\'s chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter half of the seventeenth century, and in the earlier half\\r\\nof the eighteenth century, students who wished to learn the practice of\\r\\nthe law usually entered the offices of attorneys in large practice. At\\r\\nthat period, the division between the two branches of the profession was\\r\\nmuch less wide than it subsequently became; and no rule or maxim of\\r\\nprofessional etiquette forbade Inns-of-Court men to act as the\\r\\nsubordinates of attorneys and solicitors. Thus Philip Yorke (Lord\\r\\nHardwicke) in Queen Anne\\'s reign acted as clerk in the office of Mr.\\r\\nSalkeld, an attorney residing in Brook Street, Holborn, whilst he kept\\r\\nhis terms at the Temple; and nearly fifty years later, Ned Thurlow (Lord\\r\\nThurlow), on leaving Cambridge, and taking up his residence in the\\r\\nTemple, became a pupil in the office of Mr. Chapman, a solicitor, whose\\r\\nplace of business was in Lincoln\\'s Inn. There is no doubt that it was\\r\\ncustomary for young men destined the bar thus to work in attorneys\\'\\r\\noffices; and they continued to do so without any sense of humiliation or\\r\\nthought of condescension, until the special pleaders superseded the\\r\\nattorneys as instructors.\\r\\n\\r\\n[29] The mention of \\'the Hardwicke\\' brings a droll story to the writer\\'s\\r\\nmind. Some few years since the members of that learned fraternity\\r\\nassembled at their customary plate of meeting--a large room in\\r\\nAnderton\\'s Hotel, Fleet Street--to discuss a knotty point of law about\\r\\nanent Uses. The master of young men was strong; and amongst\\r\\nthem--conspicuous for his advanced years, jovial visage, red nose, and\\r\\nair of perplexity--sate an old gentleman who was evidently a stranger to\\r\\nevery lawyer present. Who was he? Who brought him? Was there any one in\\r\\nthe room who knew him? Such were the whispers that floated about,\\r\\nconcerning the portly old man, arrayed in blue coat and drab breeches\\r\\nand gaiters, who took his snuff in silence, and watched the proceedings\\r\\nwith evident surprise and dissatisfaction. After listening to three\\r\\nspeeches this antique, jolly stranger rose, and with much embarrassment\\r\\naddressed the chair. \"Mr. President,\" he said--\"excuse me; but may I\\r\\nask,--is this \\'The Convivial Rabbits?\\'\" A roar of laughter followed this\\r\\nenquiry from a \\'convivial rabbit,\\' who having mistaken the evening of\\r\\nthe week, had wandered into the room in which his convivial\\r\\nfellow-clubsters had held a meeting on the previous evening. On\\r\\nreceiving the President\\'s assurance that the learned members of a\\r\\nlaw-debating society were not \\'convivial rabbits,\\' the elderly stranger\\r\\nbuttoned his blue coat and beat a speedy retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART VIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nMIRTH.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nWIT OF LAWYERS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo lawyer has given better witticisms to the jest-books than Sir Thomas\\r\\nMore. Like all legal wits, he enjoyed a pun, as Sir Thomas Manners, the\\r\\nmushroom Earl of Rutland discovered, when he winced under the cutting\\r\\nreproof of his insolence, conveyed in the translation of \\'Honores mutant\\r\\nmores\\'--_Honors change manners_. But though he would condescend to play\\r\\nwith words as a child plays with shells on a sea-beach, he could at will\\r\\ncommand the laughter of his readers without having recourse to mere\\r\\nverbal antics. He delighted in what may be termed humorous\\r\\nmystification. Entering Bruges at a time when his leaving had gained\\r\\nEuropean notoriety, he was met by the challenge of a noisy fellow who\\r\\nproclaimed himself ready to dispute with the whole world--or any other\\r\\nman--\"in omni scibili et de quolibet ente.\" Accepting the invitation,\\r\\nand entering the lists in the presence of all the scholastic magnates of\\r\\nBruges, More gravely inquired, \"An averia carucæ capta in vetitonamio\\r\\nsint irreplegibilia?\" Not versed in the principles and terminology of\\r\\nthe common law of England, the challenger could only stammer and\\r\\nblush--whilst More\\'s eye twinkled maliciously, and his auditors were\\r\\nconvulsed with laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of his humor was of the sort that is ordinarily called _quiet_\\r\\nhumor, because its effect does not pass off in shouts of merriment. Of\\r\\nthis kind of pleasantry he gave the Lieutenant of the Tower a specimen,\\r\\nwhen he said, with as much courtesy as irony, \"Assure yourself I do not\\r\\ndislike my cheer; but whenever I do, then spare not to thrust me out of\\r\\nyour doors!\" Of the same sort were the pleasantries with which, on the\\r\\nmorning of his execution, he with fine consideration for others strove\\r\\nto divert attention from the cruelty of his doom. \"I see no danger,\" he\\r\\nobserved, with a smile, to his friend Sir Thomas Pope, shaking his\\r\\nwater-bottle as he spoke, \"but that this man may live longer if it\\r\\nplease the king.\" Finding in the craziness of the scaffold a good\\r\\npretext for leaning in friendly fashion on his gaoler\\'s arm, he extended\\r\\nhis hand to Sir William Kingston, saying, \"Master Lieutenant, I pray you\\r\\nsee me safe up; for my coming down let me shift for myself.\" Even to the\\r\\nheadsman he gave a gentle pleasantry and a smile from the block itself,\\r\\nas he put aside his beard so that the keen blade should not touch it.\\r\\n\"Wait, my good friend, till I have removed my beard,\" he said, turning\\r\\nhis eyes upwards to the official, \"for it has never offended his\\r\\nhighness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wit was not less ready than brilliant, and on one occasion its\\r\\nreadiness saved him from a sudden and horrible death. Sitting on the\\r\\nroof of his high gate-house at Chelsea, he was enjoying the beauties of\\r\\nthe Thames and the sunny richness of the landscape, when his solitude\\r\\nwas broken by the unlooked-for arrival of a wandering maniac. Wearing\\r\\nthe horn and badge of a Bedlamite, the unfortunate creature showed the\\r\\nsigns of his malady in his equipment as well as his countenance. Having\\r\\ncast his eye downwards from the parapet to the foot of the tower, he\\r\\nconceived a mad desire to hurl the Chancellor from the flat roof. \"Leap,\\r\\nTom! leap!\" screamed the athletic fellow, laying a firm hand on More\\'s\\r\\nshoulder. Fixing his attention with a steady look, More said, coolly,\\r\\n\"Let us first throw my little dog down, and see what sport that will\\r\\nbe.\" In a trice the dog was thrown into the air. \"Good!\" said More,\\r\\nfeigning delight at the experiment: \"now run down, fetch the dog, and\\r\\nwe\\'ll throw him off again.\" Obeying the command, the dangerous intruder\\r\\nleft More free to secure himself by a bar, and to summon assistance with\\r\\nhis voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a good end this wise and mirth-loving lawyer would play the part of\\r\\na practical joker; and it is recorded that by a jest of the practical\\r\\nsort he gave a wholesome lesson to an old civic magistrate, who, at the\\r\\nSessions of the Old Bailey, was continually telling the victims of\\r\\ncut-purses that they had only themselves to thank for their losses--that\\r\\npurses would never be cut if their wearers took proper care to retain\\r\\nthem in their possession. These orations always terminated with, \"I\\r\\nnever lose _my_ purse; cut-purses never take _my_ purse; no, i\\'faith,\\r\\nbecause I take proper care of it.\" To teach his worship wisdom, and cure\\r\\nhim of his self-sufficiency, More engaged a cut-purse to relieve the\\r\\nmagistrate of his money-bag whilst he sat upon the bench. A story is\\r\\nrecorded of another Old Bailey judge who became the victim of a thief\\r\\nunder very ridiculous circumstances. Whilst he was presiding at the\\r\\ntrial of a thief in the Old Bailey, Sir John Sylvester, Recorder of\\r\\nLondon, said incidentally that he had left his watch at home. The trial\\r\\nended in an acquittal, the prisoner had no sooner gained his liberty\\r\\nthan he hastened to the recorder\\'s house, and sent in word to Lady\\r\\nSylvester that he was a constable and had been sent from the Old Bailey\\r\\nto fetch her husband\\'s watch. When the recorder returned home and found\\r\\nhe had lost his watch, it is to be feared that Lady Sylvester lost her\\r\\nusual equanimity. _Apropos_ of these stories Lord Campbell tells--how,\\r\\nat the opening period of his professional career, soon after the\\r\\npublication of his \\'Nisi Prius Reports,\\' he on circuit successfully\\r\\ndefended a prisoner charged with a criminal offence; and how, whilst the\\r\\nsuccess of his advocacy was still quickening his pulses, he discovered\\r\\nthat his late client, with whom he held a confidential conversation, had\\r\\ncontrived to relieve him of his pocket-book, full of bank-notes. As soon\\r\\nas the presiding judge, Lord Chief Baron Macdonald, heard of the mishap\\r\\nof the reporting barrister, he exclaimed, \"What! does Mr. Campbell think\\r\\nthat no one is entitled to _take notes_ in court except himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the urbane placidity which marked the utterance of his happiest\\r\\nspeeches, Sir Nicholas Bacon often recalled to his hearers the courteous\\r\\neasiness of More\\'s _repartees_. Keeping his own pace in society, as well\\r\\nas in the Court of Chancery, neither satire nor importunity could ruffle\\r\\nor confuse him. When Elizabeth, looking disdainfully at his modest\\r\\ncountry mansion, told him that the place was too small, he answered with\\r\\nthe flattery of gratitude, \"Not so, madam, your highness has made me too\\r\\ngreat for my house.\" Leicester having suddenly asked him his opinion of\\r\\ntwo aspirants for court favor, he responded on the spur of the moment,\\r\\n\"By my troth, my lord, the one is a grave councillor: the other is a\\r\\nproper young man, and so he will be as long as he lives.\" To the queen,\\r\\nwho pressed him for his sentiments respecting the effect of\\r\\nmonopolies--a delicate question for a subject to speak his mind\\r\\nupon--he answered, with conciliatory lightness, \"Madam, will you have me\\r\\nspeak the truth? _Licentiâ_ omnes deteriores sumus.\" In court he used to\\r\\nsay, \"Let us stay a little, that we may have done the sooner.\" But\\r\\nnotwithstanding his deliberation and the stutter that hindered his\\r\\nutterances, he could be quicker than the quickest, and sharper than the\\r\\nmost acrid, as the loquacious barrister discovered who was suddenly\\r\\nchecked in a course of pert talkativeness by this tart remark from the\\r\\nstammering Lord Keeper: \"There is a difference between you and me,--for\\r\\nme it is a pain to s-speak, for you a pain to hold your tongue.\" That\\r\\nthe familiar story of his fatal attack of cold is altogether true one\\r\\ncannot well believe, for it seems highly improbable that the Lord\\r\\nKeeper, in his seventieth year, would have sat down to be shaved near an\\r\\nopen window in the month of February. But though the anecdote may not be\\r\\nhistorically exact, it may be accepted as a faithful portraiture of his\\r\\nmore stately and severely courteous humor. \"Why did you suffer me to\\r\\nsleep thus exposed?\" asked the Lord Keeper, waking in a fit of shivering\\r\\nfrom slumber into which his servant had allowed him to drop, as he sat\\r\\nto be shaved in a place where there was a sharp current of air. \"Sir, I\\r\\ndurst not disturb you,\" answered the punctilious valet, with a lowly\\r\\nobeisance. Having eyed him for a few seconds, Sir Nicholas rose and\\r\\nsaid, \"By your civility I lose my life.\" Whereupon the Lord Keeper\\r\\nretired to the bed from which he never rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst Elizabethan Judges who aimed at sprightliness on the Bench,\\r\\nHatton merits a place; but there is reason to think that the idlers, who\\r\\ncrowded his court to admire the foppishness of his judicial costume, did\\r\\nnot get one really good _mot_ from his lips to every ten bright sayings\\r\\nthat came from the clever barristers practising before him. One of the\\r\\nbest things attributed to him is a pun. In a case concerning the limits\\r\\nof certain land, the counsel on one side having remarked with\\r\\nexplanatory emphasis, \"We lie on this side, my Lord;\" and the counsel on\\r\\nthe other side having interposed with equal vehemence, \"We lie on this\\r\\nside, my Lord,\"--the Lord Chancellor leaned backwards, and dryly\\r\\nobserved, \"If you lie on both sides, whom am I to believe?\" In\\r\\nElizabethan England the pun was as great a power in the jocularity of\\r\\nthe law-courts as it is at present; the few surviving witticisms that\\r\\nare supposed to exemplify Egerton\\'s lighter mood on the bench, being for\\r\\nthe most part feeble attempts at punning. For instance, when he was\\r\\nasked, during his tenure of the Mastership of the Rolls, to _commit_ a\\r\\ncause, _i.e._, to refer it to a Master in Chancery, he used to answer,\\r\\n\"What has the cause done that it should be committed?\" It is also\\r\\nrecorded of him that, when he was asked for his signature to a petition\\r\\nof which he disapproved, he would tear it in pieces with both hands,\\r\\nsaying, \"You want my hand to this? You shall have it; aye, and both my\\r\\nhands, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Egerton\\'s student days a story is extant, which has merits,\\r\\nindependent of its truth or want of truth. The hostess of a Smithfield\\r\\ntavern had received a sum of money from three graziers, in trust for\\r\\nthem, and on engagement to restore it to them on their joint demand.\\r\\nSoon after this transfer, one of the co-depositors, fraudulently\\r\\nrepresenting himself to be acting as the agent of the other two, induced\\r\\nthe old lady to give him possession of the whole of the money--and\\r\\nthereupon absconded. Forthwith the other two depositors brought an\\r\\naction against the landlady, and were on the point of gaining a decision\\r\\nin their favor, when young Egerton, who had been taking notes of the\\r\\ntrial, rose as _amicus curiæ_, and argued, \"This money, by the contract,\\r\\nwas to be returned to _three_, but _two_ only sue;--where is the\\r\\n_third_? let him appear with the others; till then the money cannot be\\r\\ndemanded from her.\" Nonsuit for the plaintiffs--for the young student a\\r\\nhum of commendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the pungent sayings current in Westminster Hall at the present\\r\\ntime, and attributed to eminent advocates who either are still upon the\\r\\nforensic stage, or have recently withdrawn from it, were common jests\\r\\namongst the lawyers of the seventeenth century. What law-student now\\r\\neating dinners at the Temple has not heard the story of Sergeant\\r\\nWilkins, who, on drinking a pot of stout in the middle of the day,\\r\\nexplained that, as he was about to appear in court, he thought it right\\r\\nto fuddle his brain down to the intellectual standard of a British jury.\\r\\nThis merry thought, two hundred and fifty years since, was currently\\r\\nattributed to Sir John Millicent, of Cambridgeshire, of whom it is\\r\\nrecorded--\"being asked how he did conforme himselfe to the grave\\r\\njustices his brothers, when they met, \\'Why, in faithe,\\' sayes he, \\'I\\r\\nhave no way but to drinke myself downe to the capacitie of the Bench.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother witticism, currently attributed to various recent celebrities,\\r\\nbut usually fathered upon Richard Brinsley Sheridan--on whose reputation\\r\\nhave been heaped the brilliant _mots_ of many a speaker whom he never\\r\\nheard, and the indiscretions of many a sinner whom he never knew--is\\r\\ncertainly as old as Shaftesbury\\'s bright and unprincipled career. When\\r\\nCharles II. exclaimed, \"Shaftesbury, you are the most profligate man in\\r\\nmy dominions,\" the reckless Chancellor answered, \"Of a subject, sir, I\\r\\nbelieve I am.\" It is likely enough that Shaftesbury merely repeated the\\r\\nwitticism of a previous courtier; but it is certain that Sheridan was\\r\\nnot the first to strike out the pun.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this place let a contradiction be given to a baseless story, which\\r\\nexalts Sir William Follett\\'s reputation for intellectual readiness and\\r\\nargumentative ability. The story runs, that early in the January of\\r\\n1845, whilst George Stephenson, Dean Buckland, and Sir William Follett\\r\\nwere Sir Robert Peel\\'s guests at Drayton Manor, Dean Buckland vanquished\\r\\nthe engineer in a discussion on a geological question. The next morning,\\r\\nGeorge Stephenson was walking in the gardens of Drayton Manor before\\r\\nbreakfast, when Sir William Follett accosted him, and sitting down in an\\r\\narbor asked for the facts of the argument. Having quickly \\'picked up the\\r\\ncase,\\' the lawyer joined Sir Robert Peel\\'s guests at breakfast, and\\r\\namused them by leading the dean back to the dispute of the previous day,\\r\\nand overthrowing his fallacies by a skilful use of the same arguments\\r\\nwhich the self-taught engineer had employed with such ill effect. \"What\\r\\ndo you say, Mr. Stephenson?\" asked Sir Robert Peel, enjoying the dean\\'s\\r\\ndiscomfiture. \"Why,\" returned George Stephenson, \"I only say this, that\\r\\nof all the powers above and under earth, there seems to me no power so\\r\\ngreat as the gift of the gab.\" This is the story. But there are facts\\r\\nwhich contradict it. The only visit paid by George Stephenson to Drayton\\r\\nManor was made in the December of 1844, not the January of 1845. The\\r\\nguests (invited for Dec. 14, 1844), were Lord Talbot, Lord Aylesford,\\r\\nthe Bishop of Lichfield, Dr. Buckland, Dr. Lyon Playfair, Professor\\r\\nOwen, George Stephenson, Mr. Smith of Deanston, and Professor\\r\\nWheatstone. Sir William Follett was not of the party, and did not set\\r\\nfoot within Drayton Manor during George Stephenson\\'s visit there. Of\\r\\nthis, Professor Wheatstone (who furnished the present writer with these\\r\\nparticulars), is certain. Moreover, it is not to be believed that Sir\\r\\nWilliam Follett, an overworked invalid (who died in the June of 1845 of\\r\\nthe pulmonary disease under which he had suffered for years), would sit\\r\\nin an arbor before breakfast on a winter\\'s morning to hold debate with\\r\\na companion on any subject. The story is a revival of an anecdote first\\r\\ntold long before George Stephenson was born.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn lists of legal _facetiæ_ the habit of punning is not more noticeable\\r\\nthan the prevalent unamiability of the jests. Advocates are intellectual\\r\\ngladiators, using their tongues as soldiers of fortune use their swords;\\r\\nand when they speak, it is to vanquish an adversary. Antagonism is an\\r\\nunavoidable condition of their existence; and this incessant warfare\\r\\ngives a merciless asperity to their language, even when it does not\\r\\ninfuse their hearts with bitterness. Duty enjoins the barrister to leave\\r\\nno word unsaid that can help his client, and encourages him to perplex\\r\\nby satire, baffle by ridicule, or silence by sarcasm, all who may oppose\\r\\nhim with statements that cannot be disproved, or arguments that cannot\\r\\nbe upset by reason. That which duty bids him do, practice enables him to\\r\\ndo with terrible precision and completeness; and in many a case the\\r\\ncaustic tone, assumed at the outset as a professional weapon, becomes\\r\\nhabitual, and, without the speaker\\'s knowledge, gives more pain within\\r\\nhis home than in Westminster Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the well-known witticisms attributed to great lawyers are so\\r\\nbrutally personal and malignant, that no man possessing any respect for\\r\\nhuman nature can read them without endeavoring to regard them as mere\\r\\nbiographic fabrications. It is recorded of Charles Yorke that, after his\\r\\nelection to serve as member for the University of Cambridge, he, in\\r\\naccordance with etiquette, made a round of calls on members of senate,\\r\\ngiving them personal thanks for their votes; and that on coming to the\\r\\npresence of a supporter--an old \\'fellow\\' known as the ugliest man in\\r\\nCambridge--he addressed him thus, after smiling \\'an aside\\' to a knot of\\r\\nbystanders--\"Sir, I have reason to be thankful to my friends in\\r\\ngeneral; but I confess myself under particular obligation to you for\\r\\nthe very _remarkable countenance_ you have shown me on this occasion.\"\\r\\nThere is no doubt that Charles Yorke could make himself unendurably\\r\\noffensive; it is just credible that without a thought of their double\\r\\nmeaning he uttered the words attributed to him; but it is not to be\\r\\nbelieved that he--an English gentleman--thus intentionally insulted a\\r\\nman who had rendered him a service.\\r\\n\\r\\nA story far less offensive than the preceding anecdote, but in one point\\r\\nsimilar to it, is told of Judge Fortescue-Aland (subsequently Lord\\r\\nFortescue), and a counsel. Sir John Fortescue-Aland was disfigured by a\\r\\nnose which was purple, and hideously misshapen by morbid growth. Having\\r\\nchecked a ready counsel with the needlessly harsh observation, \"Brother,\\r\\nbrother, you are handling the case in a very lame manner,\" the angry\\r\\nadvocate gave vent to his annoyance by saying, with a perfect appearance\\r\\nof _sang-froid_, \"Pardon me, my lord; have patience with me, and I will\\r\\ndo my best to make the case as plain as--as--the nose on your lordship\\'s\\r\\nface.\" In this case the personality was uttered in hot blood, by a man\\r\\nwho deemed himself to be striking the enemy of his professional\\r\\nreputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they were not supported by incontrovertible testimony, the admirers\\r\\nof the great Sir Edward Coke would reject as spurious many of the\\r\\noverbearing rejoinders which escaped his lips in courts of justice. His\\r\\ntone in his memorable altercation with Bacon at the bar of the Court of\\r\\nExchequer speaks ill for the courtesy of English advocates in\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s reign; and to any student who can appreciate the dignified\\r\\nformality and punctilious politeness that characterized English\\r\\ngentlemen in the old time, it is matter of perplexity how a man of\\r\\nCoke\\'s learning, capacity, and standing, could have marked his contempt\\r\\nfor \\'Cowells Interpreter,\\' by designating the author in open court Dr.\\r\\nCowheel. Scarcely in better taste were the coarse personalities with\\r\\nwhich, as Attorney General, he deluged Garnet the Jesuit, whom he\\r\\ndescribed as \"a Doctor of Jesuits; that is, a Doctor of six D\\'s--as\\r\\nDissimulation, Deposing of princes, Disposing of kingdoms, Daunting and\\r\\nDeterring of Subjects, and Destruction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn comparatively recent times few judges surpassed Thurlow in\\r\\noverbearing insolence to the bar. To a few favorites, such as John Scott\\r\\nand Kenyon, he could be consistently indulgent, although even to them\\r\\nhis patronage was often disagreeably contemptuous; but to those who\\r\\nprovoked his displeasure by a perfectly independent and fearless bearing\\r\\nhe was a malignant persecutor. For instance, in his animosity to Richard\\r\\nPepper Arden (Lord Alvanley), he often forgot his duty as a judge and\\r\\nhis manners as a gentleman. John Scott, on one occasion, rising in the\\r\\nCourt of Chancery to address the court after Arden, who was his leader\\r\\nin the cause, and had made an unusually able speech, Lord Thurlow had\\r\\nthe indecency to say, \"Mr. Scott, I am glad to find that you are engaged\\r\\nin the cause, for I now stand some chance of knowing something about the\\r\\nmatter.\" To the Chancellor\\'s habitual incivility and insolence it is\\r\\nallowed that Arden always responded with dignity and self-command,\\r\\nhumiliating his powerful and ungenerous adversary by invariable\\r\\ngood-breeding. Once, through inadvertence, he showed disrespect to the\\r\\nsurly Chancellor, and then he instantly gave utterance to a cordial\\r\\napology, which Thurlow was not generous enough to accept with\\r\\nappropriate courtesy. In the excitement of professional altercation with\\r\\ncounsel respecting the ages of certain persons concerned in a suit, he\\r\\ncommitted the indecorum of saying aloud, \"I\\'ll lay you a bottle of\\r\\nwine.\" Ever on the alert to catch his enemy tripping, Thurlow\\'s eye\\r\\nbrightened as his ear caught the careless words; and in another instant\\r\\nhe assumed a look of indignant disgust. But before the irate judge could\\r\\nspeak, Arden exclaimed, \"My lord, I beg your lordship\\'s pardon; I really\\r\\nforgot where I was.\" Had Thurlow bowed a grave acceptance of the\\r\\napology, Arden would have suffered somewhat from the misadventure; but\\r\\nunable to keep his abusive tongue quiet, the \\'Great Bear\\' growled out,\\r\\nin allusion to the offender\\'s Welsh judgeship, \"You thought you were in\\r\\nyour own court, I presume.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMore laughable, but not more courteous, was the same Chancellor\\'s speech\\r\\nto a solicitor who had made a series of statements in a vain endeavor to\\r\\nconvince his lordship of a certain person\\'s death. \"Really, my lord,\" at\\r\\nlast the solicitor exclaimed, goaded into a fury by Thurlow\\'s repeated\\r\\nejaculations of \"That\\'s no proof of the man\\'s death;\" \"Really, my lord,\\r\\nit is very hard, and it is not right that you won\\'t believe me. I saw\\r\\nthe man dead in his coffin. My lord, I tell you he was my client, and he\\r\\nis dead.\" \"No wonder,\" retorted Thurlow, with a grunt and a sneer,\\r\\n\"_since he was your client_. Why did you not tell me that sooner? It\\r\\nwould kill me to have such a fellow as you for my attorney.\" That this\\r\\ngreat lawyer could thus address a respectable gentleman is less\\r\\nastonishing when it is remembered, that he once horrified a party of\\r\\naristocratic visitors at a country-house by replying to a lady who\\r\\npressed him to take some grapes, \"Grapes, madam, grapes! Did not I say a\\r\\nminute ago that I had the _gripes_!\" Once this ungentle lawyer was\\r\\nfairly worsted in a verbal conflict by an Irish pavier. On crossing the\\r\\nthreshold of his Ormond Street house one morning, the Chancellor was\\r\\nincensed at seeing a load of paving-stones placed before his door.\\r\\nSingling out the tallest of a score of Irish workmen who were repairing\\r\\nthe thoroughfare, he poured upon him one of those torrents of curses\\r\\nwith which his most insolent speeches were usually preluded, and then\\r\\ntold the man to move the stones away instantly. \"Where shall I take them\\r\\nto, your honor?\" the pavier inquired. From the Chancellor another volley\\r\\nof blasphemous abuse, ending with, \"You lousy scoundrel, take them to\\r\\nhell!--do you hear me?\" \"Have a care, your honor,\" answered the workman,\\r\\nwith quiet drollery, \"don\\'t you think now that if I took \\'em to the\\r\\nother place your honor would be less likely to fall over them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThurlow\\'s incivility to the solicitor reminds us of the cruel answer\\r\\ngiven by another great lawyer to a country attorney, who, through fussy\\r\\nanxiety for a client\\'s interests, committed a grave breach of\\r\\nprofessional etiquette. Let this attorney be called Mr. Smith, and let\\r\\nit be known that Mr. Smith, having come up to London from a secluded\\r\\ndistrict of a remote country, was present at a consultation of\\r\\ncounsellors learned in the law upon his client\\'s cause. At this\\r\\ninterview, the leading counsel in the cause, the Attorney General of the\\r\\ntime, was present and delivered his final opinion with characteristic\\r\\nclearness and precision. The consultation over, the country attorney\\r\\nretreated to the Hummums Hotel, Covent Garden, and, instead of sleeping\\r\\nover the statements made at the conference, passed a wretched and\\r\\nwakeful night, harassed by distressing fears, and agitated by a\\r\\nconviction that the Attorney General had overlooked the most important\\r\\npoint of the case. Early next day, Mr. Smith, without appointment, was\\r\\nat the great counsellor\\'s chambers, and by vehement importunity, as well\\r\\nas a liberal donation to the clerk, succeeded in forcing his way to the\\r\\nadvocate\\'s presence. \"Well, Mis-ter Smith,\" observed the Attorney\\r\\nGeneral to his visitor, turning away from one of his devilling juniors,\\r\\nwho chanced to be closeted with him at the moment of the intrusion,\\r\\n\"what may you want to say? Be quick, for I am pressed for time.\"\\r\\nNotwithstanding the urgency of his engagements, he spoke with a slowness\\r\\nwhich, no less than the suspicious rattle of his voice, indicated the\\r\\nfervor of displeasure. \"Sir Causticus Witherett, I trust you will excuse\\r\\nmy troubling you; but, sir, after our yesterday\\'s interview, I went to\\r\\nmy hotel, the Hummums, in Covent Garden, and have spent the evening and\\r\\nall night turning over my client\\'s case in my mind, and the more I turn\\r\\nthe matter over in my mind, the more reason I see to fear that you have\\r\\nnot given one point due consideration.\" A pause, during which Sir\\r\\nCausticus steadily eyed his visitor, who began to feel strangely\\r\\nembarrassed under the searching scrutiny: and then--\"State the point,\\r\\nMis-ter Smith, but be brief.\" Having heard the point stated, Sir\\r\\nCausticus Witherett inquired, \"Is that all you wish to say?\" \"All,\\r\\nsir--all,\" replied Mr. Smith; adding nervously, \"And I trust you will\\r\\nexcuse me for troubling you about the matter; but, sir, I could not\\r\\nsleep a wink last night; all through the night I was turning this matter\\r\\nover in my mind.\" A glimpse of silence. Sir Causticus rose and standing\\r\\nover his victim made his final speech--\"Mis-ter Smith, if you take my\\r\\nadvice, given with sincere commiseration for your state, you will\\r\\nwithout delay return to the tranquil village in which you habitually\\r\\nreside. In the quietude of your accustomed scenes you will have leisure\\r\\nto _turn this matter over in what you are pleased to call your mind_.\\r\\nAnd I am willing to hope that _your mind_ will recover its usual\\r\\nserenity. Mr. Smith, I wish you a very good morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLegal biography abounds with ghastly stories that illustrate the\\r\\ninsensibility with which the hanging judges in past generations used to\\r\\ndon the black cap jauntily, and smile at the wretched beings whom they\\r\\nsentenced to death. Perhaps of all such anecdotes the most thoroughly\\r\\nsickening is that which describes the conduct of Jeffreys, when, as\\r\\nRecorder of London, he passed sentence of death on his old and familiar\\r\\nfriend, Richard Langhorn, the Catholic barrister--one of the victims of\\r\\nthe Popish Plot phrensy. It is recorded that Jeffreys, not content with\\r\\nconsigning his friend to a traitor\\'s doom, malignantly reminded him of\\r\\ntheir former intercourse, and with devilish ridicule admonished him to\\r\\nprepare his soul for the next world. The authority which gives us this\\r\\nstory adds, that by thus insulting a wretched gentleman and personal\\r\\nassociate, Jeffreys, instead of rousing the disgust of his auditors,\\r\\nelicited their enthusiastic applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a note to a passage in one of the Waverley Novels, Scott tells a\\r\\nstory of an old Scotch judge, who, as an enthusiastic chess-player, was\\r\\nmuch mortified by the success of an ancient friend, who invariably beat\\r\\nhim when they tried their powers at the beloved game. After a time the\\r\\nhumiliated chess-player had his day of triumph. His conqueror happened\\r\\nto commit murder, and it became the judge\\'s not altogether painful duty\\r\\nto pass upon him the sentence of the law. Having in due form and with\\r\\nsuitable solemnity commended his soul to the divine mercy, he, after a\\r\\nbrief pause, assumed his ordinary colloquial tone of voice, and nodding\\r\\nhumorously to his old friend, observed--\"And noo, Jammie, I think ye\\'ll\\r\\nalloo that I hae checkmated you for ance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the bloodthirsty wearers of the ermine, no one, since the opening\\r\\nof the eighteenth century, has fared worse than Sir Francis Page--the\\r\\nvirulence of whose tongue and the cruelty of whose nature were marks for\\r\\nsuccessive satirists. In one of his Imitations of Horace, Pope says--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Slanderer, poison dread from Delia\\'s rage,\\r\\n   Hard words or hanging, if your judge be Page.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same spirit the poet penned the lines of the \\'Dunciad\\'--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Mortality, by her false guardians drawn,\\r\\n   Chicane in furs, and Casuistry in lawn,\\r\\n   Gasps, as they straighten at each end the cord,\\r\\n   And dies, when Dulness gives her----the Sword.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPowerless to feign insensibility to the blow, Sir Francis openly fitted\\r\\nthis _black_ cap to his dishonored head by sending his clerk to\\r\\nexpostulate with the poet. The ill-chosen ambassador performed his\\r\\nmission by showing that, in Sir Francis\\'s opinion, the whole passage\\r\\nwould be sheer nonsense, unless \\'Page\\' were inserted in the vacant\\r\\nplace. Johnson and Savage took vengeance on the judge for the judicial\\r\\nmisconduct which branded the latter poet a murderer; and Fielding, in\\r\\n\\'Tom Jones,\\' illustrating by a current story the offensive levity of the\\r\\njudge\\'s demeanor at capital trials, makes him thus retort on a\\r\\nhorse-stealer: \"Ay! thou art a lucky fellow; I have traveled the circuit\\r\\nthese forty years, and never found a horse in my life; but I\\'ll tell\\r\\nthee what, friend, thou wast more lucky than thou didst know of; for\\r\\nthou didst not only find a horse, but a halter too, I promise thee.\"\\r\\nThis scandal to his professional order was permitted to insult the\\r\\nhumane sentiments of the nation for a long period. Born in 1661, he died\\r\\nin 1741, whilst he was still occupying a judicial place; and it is said\\r\\nof him, that in his last year he pointed the ignominious story of his\\r\\nexistence by a speech that soon ran the round of the courts. In answer\\r\\nto an inquiry for his health, the octogenarian judge observed, \"My dear\\r\\nsir--you see how it fares with me; I just manage to keep _hanging on,\\r\\nhanging on_.\" This story is ordinarily told as though the old man did\\r\\nnot see the unfavorable significance of his words; but it is probable\\r\\nthat, he uttered them wittingly and with, a sneer--in the cynicism and\\r\\nshamelessness of old age.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man of finer stuff and of various merits, but still famous as a\\r\\n\\'hanging judge,\\' was Sir Francis Buller, who also made himself odious to\\r\\nthe gentler sex by maintaining that husbands might flog their wives, if\\r\\nthe chastisement were administered with a stick not thicker than the\\r\\noperator\\'s thumb. But the severity to criminals, which gave him a place\\r\\namongst hanging judges, was not a consequence of natural cruelty.\\r\\nInability to devise a satisfactory system of secondary punishments, and\\r\\na genuine conviction that ninety-nine out of every hundred culprits were\\r\\nincorrigible, caused him to maintain that the gallows-tree was the most\\r\\nefficacious as well as the cheapest instrument that could be invented\\r\\nfor protecting society against malefactors. Another of his stern _dicta_\\r\\nwas, that previous good character was a reason for increasing rather\\r\\nthan a reason for lessening a culprit\\'s punishment; \"For,\" he argued,\\r\\n\"the longer a prisoner has enjoyed the good opinion of the world, the\\r\\nless are the excuses for his misdeeds, and the more injurious is his\\r\\nconduct to public morality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to these odious stories of hanging judges are some anecdotes\\r\\nof great men, who abhorred the atrocities of our penal system, long\\r\\nbefore the worst of them were swept away by reform. Lord Mansfield has\\r\\nnever been credited with lively sensibilities, but his humanity was so\\r\\nshocked by the bare thought of killing a man for committing a trifling\\r\\ntheft, that he on one occasion ordered a jury to find that a stolen\\r\\ntrinket was of less value than forty shillings--in order that the thief\\r\\nmight escape the capital sentence. The prosecutor, a dealer in jewelry,\\r\\nwas so mortified by the judge\\'s leniency, that he exclaimed, \"What, my\\r\\nlord, my golden trinket not worth forty shillings? Why, the fashion\\r\\nalone cost me twice the money!\" Removing his glance from the vindictive\\r\\ntradesman, Lord Mansfield turned towards the jury, and said, with solemn\\r\\ngravity, \"As we stand in need of God\\'s mercy, gentlemen, let us not hang\\r\\na man for fashion\\'s sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTenderness of heart was even less notable in Kenyon than in Murray; but\\r\\nLord Mansfield\\'s successor was at least on one occasion stirred by\\r\\napathetic consequence of the bloody law against persons found guilty of\\r\\ntrivial theft. On the Home Circuit, having passed sentence of death on a\\r\\npoor woman who had stolen property to the value of forty shillings in a\\r\\ndwelling-house, Lord Kenyon saw the prisoner drop lifeless in the dock,\\r\\njust as he ceased to speak. Instantly the Chief Justice sprang to his\\r\\nfeet, and screamed in a shrill tone, \"I don\\'t mean to hang you--do you\\r\\nhear!--don\\'t you hear?--Good----will nobody tell her that I don\\'t mean\\r\\nto hang her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the humorous aspects of a repulsive subject is seen in the\\r\\ncuriosity and fastidiousness of prisoners on trial for capital offences\\r\\nwith regard to the professional _status_ of the judges who try them. A\\r\\nsheep-stealer of the old bloody days liked that sentence should be\\r\\npassed upon him by a Chief Justice; and in our own time murderers\\r\\nawaiting execution, sometimes grumble at the unfairness of their trials,\\r\\nbecause they have been tried by judges of inferior degree. Lord Campbell\\r\\nmentions the case of a sergeant, who, whilst acting as Chief Justice\\r\\nAbbott\\'s deputy, on the Oxford circuit, was reminded that he was \\'merely\\r\\na temporary\\' by the prisoner in the dock. Being asked in the usual way\\r\\nif he had aught to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon\\r\\nhim, the prisoner answered--\"_Yes; I have been tried before a journeyman\\r\\njudge._\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XL.\\r\\n\\r\\nHUMOROUS STORIES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlike commendable for its subtlety and inoffensive humor was the\\r\\npleasantry with which young Philip Yorke (afterwards Lord Hardwicke),\\r\\nanswered Sir Lyttleton Powys\\'s banter on the Western Circuit. An amiable\\r\\nand upright, but far from brilliant judge, Sir Lyttleton had a few pet\\r\\nphrases---amongst them, \"I humbly conceive,\" and \"Look, do you\\r\\nsee\"--which he sprinkled over his judgments and colloquial talk with\\r\\nridiculous profuseness. Surprised at Yorke\\'s sudden rise into lucrative\\r\\npractice, this most gentlemanlike worthy was pleased to account for the\\r\\nunusual success by maintaining that young Mr. Yorke must have written a\\r\\nlaw-book, which had brought him early into favor with the inferior\\r\\nbranch of the profession. \"Mr. Yorke,\" said the venerable justice,\\r\\nwhilst the barristers were sitting over their wine at a \\'judges\\'\\r\\ndinner,\\' \"I cannot well account for your having so much business,\\r\\nconsidering how short a time you have been at the bar: I humbly conceive\\r\\nyou must have published something; for look you, do you see, there is\\r\\nscarcely a cause in court but you are employed in it on one side or the\\r\\nother. I should therefore be glad to know, Mr. Yorke, do you see,\\r\\nwhether this be the case.\" Playfully denying that he possessed any\\r\\ncelebrity as a writer on legal matters, Yorke, with an assumption of\\r\\ncandor, admitted that he had some thoughts of lightening the labors of\\r\\nlaw-students by turning Coke upon Littleton into verse. Indeed, he\\r\\nconfessed that he had already begun the work of versification. Not\\r\\nseeing the nature of the reply, Sir Lyttleton Powys treated the droll\\r\\nfancy as a serious project, and insisted that the author should give a\\r\\nspecimen of the style of his contemplated work. Whereupon the young\\r\\nbarrister--not pausing to remind a company of lawyers of the words of\\r\\nthe original. \"Tenant in fee simple is he which hath lands or tenements\\r\\nto hold to him and his heirs for ever\"--recited the lines--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"He that holdeth his lands in fee\\r\\n     Need neither to quake nor quiver,\\r\\n   _I humbly conceive: for look, do you see_\\r\\n     They are his and his heirs\\' forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mimicry of voice being not less perfect than the verbal imitation,\\r\\nYorke\\'s hearers were convulsed with laughter, but so unconscious was Sir\\r\\nLyttleton of the ridicule which he had incurred, that on subsequently\\r\\nencountering Yorke in London, he asked how \"that translation of Coke\\r\\nupon Littleton was getting on.\" Sir Lyttleton died in 1732, and exactly\\r\\nten years afterwards appeared the first edition of \\'The Reports of Sir\\r\\nEdward Coke, Knt., in Verse\\'--a work which its author may have been\\r\\ninspired to undertake by Philip Yorke\\'s proposal to versify \\'Coke on\\r\\nLittleton.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Yorke\\'s project been carried out, lawyers would have a large supply\\r\\nof that comic but sound literature of which Sir James Burrow\\'s Reports\\r\\ncontain a specimen in the following poetical version of Chief Justice\\r\\nPratt\\'s memorable decision with regard to a woman of English birth, who\\r\\nwas the widow of a foreigner:\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"A woman having settlement\\r\\n     Married a man with none,\\r\\n   The question was, he being dead,\\r\\n     If what she had was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Quoth Sir John Pratt, \\'The settlement\\r\\n     Suspended did remain,\\r\\n   Living the husband; but him dead\\r\\n     It doth revive again.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n   (_Chorus of Puisne Judges._)\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Living the husband; but him dead\\r\\n     It doth revive again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChief Justice Pratt\\'s decision on this point having been reversed by his\\r\\nsuccessor, Chief Justice Ryder\\'s judgment was thus reported:\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"A woman having a settlement,\\r\\n     Married a man with none,\\r\\n   He flies and leaves her destitute;\\r\\n     What then is to be done?\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Quoth Ryder, the Chief Justice,\\r\\n     \\'In spite of Sir John Pratt,\\r\\n   You\\'ll send her to the parish\\r\\n     In which she was a brat.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"\\'_Suspension of a settlement_\\r\\n     Is not to be maintained;\\r\\n   That which she had by birth subsists\\r\\n     Until another\\'s gained.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n   (_Chorus of Puisne Judges._)\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"That which she had by birth subsists\\r\\n     Until another\\'s gained.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early months of his married life, whilst playing the part of an\\r\\nOxford don, Lord Eldon was required to decide in an important action\\r\\nbrought by two undergraduates against the cook of University College.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs declared that the cook had \"sent to their rooms an\\r\\napple-pie _that could not be eaten_.\" The defendant pleaded that he had\\r\\na remarkably fine fillet of veal in the kitchen. Having set aside this\\r\\nplea on grounds obvious to the legal mind, and not otherwise then\\r\\nmanifest to unlearned laymen, Mr. John Scott ordered the apple-pie to be\\r\\nbrought in court; but the messenger, dispatched to do the judge\\'s\\r\\nbidding, returned with the astounding intelligence that during the\\r\\nprogress of the litigation a party of undergraduates had actually\\r\\ndevoured the pie--fruit and crust. Nothing but the pan was left.\\r\\nJudgment: \"The charge here is, that the cook has sent up an apple-pie\\r\\nthat cannot be eaten. Now that cannot be said to have been uneatable\\r\\nwhich has been eaten; and as this apple-pie has been eaten, it was\\r\\neatable. Let the cook be absolved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of all the judicial decisions on record, none was delivered with\\r\\nmore comical effect than Lord Loughborough\\'s decision not to hear a\\r\\ncause brought on a wager about a point in the game of \\'Hazard.\\' A\\r\\nconstant frequenter of Brookes\\'s and White\\'s, Lord Loughborough was well\\r\\nknown by men of fashion to be fairly versed in the mysteries of\\r\\ngambling, though no evidence has ever been found in support of the\\r\\ncharge that he was an habitual dicer. That he ever lost much by play is\\r\\nimprobable; but the scandal-mongers of Westminster had some plausible\\r\\nreasons for laughing at the virtuous indignation of the spotless\\r\\nAlexander Wedderburn, who, whilst sitting at _Nisi Prius_, exclaimed,\\r\\n\"Do not swear the jury in this case, but let it be struck out of the\\r\\npaper. I will not try it. The administration of justice is insulted by\\r\\nthe proposal that I should try it. To my astonishment I find that the\\r\\naction is brought on a wager as to the mode of playing an illegal,\\r\\ndisreputable, and mischievous game called \\'Hazard;\\' whether, allowing\\r\\nseven to be the main, and eleven to be a nick to seven, there are more\\r\\nways than six of nicking seven on the dice? Courts of justice are\\r\\nconstituted to try rights and redress injuries, not to solve the\\r\\nproblems of the gamesters. The gentlemen of the jury and I may have\\r\\nheard of \\'Hazard\\' as a mode of dicing by which sharpers live, and young\\r\\nmen of family and fortune are ruined; but what do any of us know of\\r\\n\\'seven being the main,\\' or \\'eleven being the nick to seven?\\' Do we come\\r\\nhere to be instructed in this lore, and are the unusual crowds (drawn\\r\\nhither, I suppose, by the novelty of the expected entertainment) to take\\r\\na lesson with us in these unholy mysteries, which they are to practice\\r\\nin the evening in the low gaming-houses in St. James Street, pithily\\r\\ncalled by a name which should inspire a salutary terror of entering\\r\\nthem? Again, I say, let the cause be struck out of the paper. Move the\\r\\ncourt, if you please, that it may be restored, and if my brethren think\\r\\nthat I do wrong in the course that I now take, I hope that one of them\\r\\nwill officiate for me here, and save me from the degradation of trying\\r\\n\\'whether there be more than six ways of nicking seven on the dice,\\r\\nallowing seven to be the main and eleven to be a nick to seven\\'--a\\r\\nquestion, after all, admitting of no doubt, and capable of mathematical\\r\\ndemonstration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith equal fervor Lord Kenyon inveighed against the pernicious usage of\\r\\ngambling, urging that the hells of St. James\\'s should, be indicted as\\r\\ncommon nuisances. The \\'legal monk,\\' as Lord Carlisle stigmatized him for\\r\\nhis violent denunciations of an amusement countenanced by women of the\\r\\nhighest fashion, even went so far as to exclaim--\"If any such\\r\\nprosecutions are fairly brought before me, and the guilty parties are\\r\\nconvicted, whatever may be their rank or station in the country, though\\r\\nthey may be the first ladies in the land, they shall certainly exhibit\\r\\nthemselves in the pillory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same considerations, which decided Lord Loughborough not to try an\\r\\naction brought by a wager concerning chicken-hazard, made Lord\\r\\nEllenborough decline to hear a cause where the plaintiff sought to\\r\\nrecover money wagered on a cock-fight. \"There is likewise,\" said Lord\\r\\nEllenborough, \"another principle on which I think an action on such\\r\\nwagers cannot be maintained. They tend to the degradation of courts of\\r\\njustice. It is impossible to be engaged in ludicrous inquiries of this\\r\\nsort consistently with that dignity which it is essential to the public\\r\\nwelfare that a court of justice should always preserve. I will not try\\r\\nthe plaintiff\\'s right to recover the four guineas, which might involve\\r\\nquestions on the weight of the cocks and the construction of their steel\\r\\nspurs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has already been remarked that in all ages the wits of Westminster\\r\\nHall have delighted in puns; and it may be here added, with the\\r\\nexception of some twenty happy verbal freaks, the puns of lawyers have\\r\\nnot been remarkable for their excellence. L\\'Estrange records that when a\\r\\nstone was hurled by a convict from the dock at Charles I.\\'s Chief\\r\\nJustice Richardson, and passed just over the head of the judge, who\\r\\nhappened to be sitting at ease and lolling on his elbow, the learned man\\r\\nsmiled, and observed to those who congratulated him on his escape, \"You\\r\\nsee now, if I had been an _upright judge_ I had been slaine.\" Under\\r\\nGeorge III. Joseph Jekyll[30] was at the same time the brightest wit and\\r\\nmost shameless punster of Westminster Hall; and such pride did he take\\r\\nin his reputation as a punster, that after the fashion of the wits of an\\r\\nearlier period he was often at considerable pains to give a pun a\\r\\nwell-wrought epigrammatic setting. Bored with the long-winded speech of\\r\\na prosy sergeant, he wrote on a slip of paper, which was in due course\\r\\npassed along the barristers\\' benches in the court where he was\\r\\nsitting--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"The sergeants are a grateful race,\\r\\n     Their dress and language show it;\\r\\n   Their purple garments come from _Tyre_,\\r\\n     Their arguments go to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Garrow, by a more skilful than successful cross-examination, was\\r\\nendeavoring to lure a witness (an unmarried lady of advanced years) into\\r\\nan acknowledgment that payment of certain money in dispute had been\\r\\ntendered, Jekyll threw him this couplet--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Garrow, forbear; that tough old jade\\r\\n   Will never prove a _tender maid_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo also, when Lord Eldon and Sir Arthur Pigott each made a stand in\\r\\ncourt for his favorite pronunciation of the word \\'lien;\\' Lord Eldon\\r\\ncalling the word _lion_ and Sir Arthur maintaining that it was to be\\r\\npronounced like _lean_, Jekyll, with an allusion to the parsimonious\\r\\narrangements of the Chancellor\\'s kitchen, perpetrated the _jeu\\r\\nd\\'esprit_--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Sir Arthur, Sir Arthur, why what do you mean\\r\\n   By saying the Chancellor\\'s _lion_ is _lean_?\\r\\n   D\\'ye think that his kitchen\\'s so bad as all that,\\r\\n   That nothing within it can ever get fat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this difference concerning the pronunciation of a word the present\\r\\nwriter is reminded of an amicable contest that occurred in Westminster\\r\\nHall between Lord Campbell and a Q.C. who is still in the front rank of\\r\\ncourt-advocates. In an action brought to recover for damages done to a\\r\\ncarriage, the learned counsel repeatedly called, the vehicle in question\\r\\na broug-ham, pronouncing both syllables of the word _brougham_.\\r\\nWhereupon, Lord Campbell with considerable pomposity observed, \"_Broom_\\r\\nis the more usual pronunciation; a carriage of the kind you mean is\\r\\ngenerally and not incorrectly called a _broom_--that pronunciation is\\r\\nopen to no grave objection, and it has the great advantage of saving the\\r\\ntime consumed by uttering an extra syllable.\" Half an hour later in the\\r\\nsame trial Lord Campbell, alluding to a decision given in a similar\\r\\naction, said, \"In that case the carriage which had sustained injury was\\r\\nan _omnibus_----\" \"Pardon me, my lord,\" interposed the Queen\\'s Counsel,\\r\\nwith such promptitude that his lordship was startled into silence, \"a\\r\\ncarriage of the kind, to which you draw attention is usually termed\\r\\n\\'bus;\\' that pronunciation is open to no grave objection, and it has the\\r\\ngreat advantage of saving the time consumed by uttering two extra\\r\\nsyllables.\" The interruption was followed by a roar of laughter, in\\r\\nwhich Lord Campbell joined more heartily than any one else.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Jekyll\\'s happy sayings was spoken at Exeter, when he defended\\r\\nseveral needlemen who were charged with raising a riot for the purpose\\r\\nof forcing the master-tailors to give higher wages. Whilst Jekyll was\\r\\nexamining a witness as to the number of tailors present at the alleged\\r\\nriot, Lord Eldon--then Chief Justice of the Common Pleas--reminded him\\r\\nthat three persons can make that which the law regards as a riot;\\r\\nwhereupon the witty advocate answered, \"Yes, my lord, Hale and Hawkins\\r\\nlay down the law as your lordship states it, and I rely on their\\r\\nauthority; for if there must be three men to make a riot, the rioters\\r\\nbeing _tailors_, there must be nine times three present, and unless the\\r\\nprosecutor make out that there were twenty-seven joining in this breach\\r\\nof the peace, my clients are entitled to an acquittal.\" On Lord Eldon\\r\\nenquiring whether he relied on common-law or statute-law, the counsel\\r\\nfor the defence answered firmly, \"My lord, I rely on a well-known maxim,\\r\\nas old as Magna Charta, _Nine Tailors make a Man_.\" Finding themselves\\r\\nunable to reward a lawyer for so excellent a jest with an adverse\\r\\nverdict, the jury acquitted the prisoners. Towards the close of his\\r\\ncareer Eldon made a still better jest than this of Jekyll\\'s concerning\\r\\ntailors. In 1829, when Lyndhurst was occupying the woolsack for the\\r\\nfirst time, and Eldon was longing to recover the seals, the latter\\r\\npresented a petition from the Tailors\\' Company at Glasgow against\\r\\nCatholic Belief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" asked Lord Lyndhurst from the woolsack, in a low voice, \"do the\\r\\n_tailors_ trouble themselves about such _measures_?\" Whereto, with\\r\\nunaccustomed quickness, the old Tory of the Tories retorted, \"No wonder;\\r\\nyou can\\'t suppose that _tailors_ like _turncoats_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs specimens of a kind of pleasantry becoming more scarce every year,\\r\\nsome of Sir George Rose\\'s court witticisms are excellent. When Mr.\\r\\nBeams, the reporter, defended himself against the _friction_ of passing\\r\\nbarristers by a wooden bar, the flimsiness of which was pointed out to\\r\\nSir George (then Mr. Rose), the wit answered--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Yes--the partition is certainly thin--\\r\\n   Yet thick enough, truly, the Beams within.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same originator of happy sayings pointed to Eldon\\'s characteristic\\r\\nweakness in the lines--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Mr. Leach made a speech,\\r\\n     Pithy, clear, and strong;\\r\\n   Mr. Hart, on the other part,\\r\\n     Was prosy, dull, and long;\\r\\n   Mr. Parker made that darker\\r\\n     Which was dark enough without;\\r\\n   Mr. Bell spoke so well,\\r\\n     That the Chancellor said--\\'I doubt.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from being offended by this allusion to his notorious mental\\r\\ninfirmity, Lord Eldon, shortly after the verses had floated into\\r\\ncirculation, concluded one of his decisions by saying, with a\\r\\nsignificant smile, \"And here _the Chancellor does not doubt_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot less remarkable for precipitancy than Eldon for procrastination, Sir\\r\\nJohn Leach, Vice-Chancellor, was said to have done more mischief by\\r\\nexcessive haste in a single term than Eldon in his whole life wrought\\r\\nthrough extreme caution. The holders of this opinion delighted to repeat\\r\\nthe poor and not perspicuous lines--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"In equity\\'s high court there are\\r\\n     Two sad extremes, \\'tis clear;\\r\\n   Excessive slowness strikes us there,\\r\\n     Excessive quickness here.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Their source, \\'twixt good and evil, brings\\r\\n     A difficulty nice;\\r\\n   The first from Eldon\\'s _virtue_, springs,\\r\\n     The latter from his _vice_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is needless to remark that this attempt to gloss the Chancellor\\'s\\r\\nshortcomings is an illustration of the readiness with which censors\\r\\napologize for the misdeeds of eminently fortunate offenders. Whilst\\r\\nEldon\\'s procrastination and Leach\\'s haste were thus put in contrast, an\\r\\nepigram also placed the Chancellor\\'s frailty in comparison with the\\r\\ntedious prolixity of the Master of the Rolls--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"To cause delay in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\n     Two diff\\'rent methods tend:\\r\\n   His lordship\\'s judgments ne\\'er begin,\\r\\n     His honors never end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA mirth-loving judge, Justice Powell, could be as thoroughly humorous in\\r\\nprivate life as he was fearless and just upon the bench. Swift describes\\r\\nhim as a surpassingly merry old gentleman, laughing heartily at all\\r\\ncomic things, and his own droll stories more than aught else. In court\\r\\nhe could not always refrain from jocularity. For instance, when he\\r\\ntried Jane Wenham for witch-craft, and she assured him that she could\\r\\nfly, his eye twinkled as he answered, \"Well, then you may; there is no\\r\\nlaw against flying.\" When Fowler, Bishop of Gloucester--a thorough\\r\\nbeliever in what is now-a-days called spiritualism--was persecuting his\\r\\nacquaintance with silly stories about ghosts, Powell gave him a telling\\r\\nreproof for his credulity by describing a horrible apparition which was\\r\\nrepresented as having disturbed the narrator\\'s rest on the previous\\r\\nnight. At the hour of midnight, as the clocks were striking twelve, the\\r\\njudge was roused from his first slumber by a hideous sound. Starting up,\\r\\nhe saw at the foot of his uncompanioned bed a figure--dark, gloomy,\\r\\nterrible, holding before its grim and repulsive visage a lamp that shed\\r\\nan uncertain light. \"May Heaven have mercy on us!\" tremulously\\r\\nejaculated the bishop at this point of the story. The judge continued\\r\\nhis story: \"Be calm, my lord bishop; be calm. The awful part of this\\r\\nmysterious interview has still to be told. Nerving myself to fashion the\\r\\nwords of inquiry, I addressed the nocturnal visitor thus--\\'Strange\\r\\nbeing, why hast thou come at this still hour to perturb a sinful\\r\\nmortal?\\' You understand, my lord, I said this in hollow tones--in what I\\r\\nmay almost term a sepulchral voice.\" \"Ay--ay,\" responded the bishop,\\r\\nwith intense excitement; \"go on--I implore you to go on. What did _it_\\r\\nanswer?\" \"It answered in a voice not greatly different from the voice of\\r\\na human creature--\\'Please, sir, _I am the watchman on beat, and your\\r\\nstreet-door is open_.\\'\" Readers will remember the use which Barham has\\r\\nmade of this story in the Ingoldsby Legends.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a Justice of the King\\'s Bench, Powell had in Chief Justice Holt an\\r\\nassociate who could not only appreciate the wit of others, but could\\r\\nhimself say smart things. When Lacy, the fanatic, forced his way into\\r\\nHolt\\'s house in Bedford Row, the Chief Justice was equal to the\\r\\noccasion. \"I come to you,\" said Lacy, \"a prophet from the Lord God, who\\r\\nhas sent me to thee and would have thee grant a _nolle prosequi_ for\\r\\nJohn Atkins, his servant, whom thou hast sent to prison.\" Whereto the\\r\\njudge answered, with proper emphasis, \"Thou art a false prophet and a\\r\\nlying knave. If the Lord God had sent thee, it would have been to the\\r\\nAttorney General, for the Lord God knows that it belongeth not to the\\r\\nChief Justice, to grant a _nolle prosequi_; but I, as Chief Justice, can\\r\\ngrant a warrant to commit thee to John Atkins\\'s company.\" Whereupon the\\r\\nfalse prophet, sharing the fate of many a true one, was forthwith\\r\\nclapped in prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that so much has been said of Thurlow\\'s brutal sarcasms, justice\\r\\ndemands for his memory an acknowledgment that he possessed a vein of\\r\\ngenuine humor that could make itself felt without wounding. In his\\r\\nundergraduate days at Cambridge he is said to have worried the tutors of\\r\\nCaius with a series of disorderly pranks and impudent _escapades_, but\\r\\non one occasion he unquestionably displayed at the university the quick\\r\\nwit that in after life rescued him from many an embarrassing position.\\r\\n\"Sir,\" observed a tutor, giving the unruly undergraduate a look of\\r\\ndisapproval, \"I never come to the window without seeing you idling in\\r\\nthe court.\" \"Sir,\" replied young Thurlow, imitating the don\\'s tone, \"I\\r\\nnever come into the court without seeing you idling at the window.\"\\r\\nYears later, when he had become a great man, and John Scott was paying\\r\\nhim assiduous court, Thurlow said, in ridicule of the mechanical\\r\\nawkwardness of many successful equity draughtsmen, \"Jack Scott, don\\'t\\r\\nyou think we could invent a machine to draw bills and answers in\\r\\nChancery?\" Having laughed at the suggestion when it was made, Scott put\\r\\naway the droll thought in his memory; and when he had risen to be\\r\\nAttorney General reminded Lord Thurlow of it under rather awkward\\r\\ncircumstances. Macnamara, the conveyancer, being concerned as one of the\\r\\nprincipals in a Chancery suit, Lord Thurlow advised him to submit the\\r\\nanswer to the bill filed against him to the Attorney General. In due\\r\\ncourse the answer came under Scott\\'s notice, when he found it so\\r\\nwretchedly drawn, that he advised Macnamara to have another answer drawn\\r\\nby some one who understood pleading. On the same day he was engaged at\\r\\nthe bar of the House of Lords, when Lord Thurlow came to him, and said,\\r\\n\"So I understand you don\\'t think my friend Mac\\'s answer will do?\" \"Do!\"\\r\\nScott replied, contemptuously. \"My Lord, it won\\'t do at all! it must\\r\\nhave been drawn by that wooden machine which you once told me might be\\r\\ninvented to draw bills and answers.\" \"That\\'s very unlucky,\" answered\\r\\nThurlow, \"and impudent too, if you had known--_that I drew the answer\\r\\nmyself_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Lyndhurst used to maintain that it was one of the chief duties of a\\r\\njudge to render it disagreeable to counsel to talk nonsense. Jeffreys in\\r\\nhis milder moments no doubt salved his conscience with the same\\r\\ndoctrine, when he recalled how, after elating him with a compliment, he\\r\\nstruck down the rising junior with \"Lord, sir! you must be cackling too.\\r\\nWe told you, Mr. Bradbury, your objection was very ingenious; that must\\r\\nnot make you troublesome: you cannot lay an egg, but you must be\\r\\ncackling over it.\" Doubtless, also, he felt it one of the chief duties\\r\\nof a judge to restrain attorneys from talking nonsense when--on hearing\\r\\nthat the solicitor from whom he received his first brief had boastfully\\r\\nremarked, in allusion to past services, \"My Lord Chancellor! I _made_\\r\\nhim!\"--he exclaimed, \"Well, then, I\\'ll lay my maker by the heels,\" and\\r\\nforthwith committed his former client and patron to the Fleet prison. If\\r\\nthis bully of the bench actually, as he is said to have done,\\r\\ninterrupted the venerable Maynard by saying, \"You have lost your\\r\\nknowledge of law; your memory, I tell you, is failing through old age,\"\\r\\nhow must every hearer of the speech have exulted when Maynard quietly\\r\\nanswered, \"Yes, Sir George, I have forgotten more law than you ever\\r\\nlearned; but allow me to say, I have not forgotten much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand it should be remembered that Maynard was a man\\r\\neminently qualified to sow violent animosities, and that he was a\\r\\nperpetual thorn in the flesh of the political barristers, whose\\r\\nprinciples he abhorred. A subtle and tricky man, he was constantly\\r\\nmisleading judges by citing fictitious authorities, and then smiling at\\r\\ntheir professional ignorance when they had swallowed his audacious\\r\\nfabrications. Moreover, the manner of his speech was sometimes as\\r\\noffensive as its substance was dishonest. Strafford spoke a bitter\\r\\ncriticism not only with regard to Maynard and Glyn, but with regard to\\r\\nthe prevailing tone of the bar, when, describing the conduct of the\\r\\nadvocates who managed his prosecution, he said: \"Glynne and Maynard used\\r\\nme _like advocates_, but Palmer and Whitelock _like gentlemen_; and yet\\r\\nthe latter left out nothing against me that was material to be urged\\r\\nagainst me.\" As a Devonshire man Maynard is one of the many cases which\\r\\nmay be cited against the smart saying of Sergeant Davy, who used to\\r\\nobserve: \"The further I journey toward the West, the more convinced I am\\r\\nthat the wise men come from the East.\" But shrewd, observant, liberal\\r\\nthough he was in most respects, he was on one matter so far behind the\\r\\nspirit of the age that, blinded and ruled by an unwise sentiment, he\\r\\ngave his parliamentary support to an abortive measure \"to prevent\\r\\nfurther building in London and the neighborhood.\" In support of this\\r\\nmeasure he observed, \"This building is the ruin of the gentry and ruin\\r\\nof religion, as leaving many good people without churches to go to.\\r\\nThis enlarging of London makes it filled with lacqueys and pages. In St.\\r\\nGiles\\'s parish scarce the fifth part come to church, and we shall have\\r\\nno religion at last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst justice has suffered something in respect of dignity from the\\r\\noverbearing temper of judges to counsel, from collisions of the bench\\r\\nwith the bar, and from the mutual hostility of rival advocates, she has\\r\\nat times sustained even greater injury from the jealousies and\\r\\naltercations of judges. Too often wearers of the ermine, sitting on the\\r\\nsame bench, nominally for the purpose of assisting each other, have\\r\\nroused the laughter of the bar, and the indignation of suitors, by their\\r\\npetty squabbles. \"It now comes to my turn,\" an Irish judge observed,\\r\\nwhen it devolved on him to support the decision of one or the other of\\r\\ntwo learned coadjutors, who had stated with more fervor than courtesy\\r\\naltogether irreconcilable opinions--\"It now comes to my turn to declare\\r\\nmy view of the case, and fortunately I can be brief. I agree with my\\r\\nbrother A, from the irresistible force of my brother B\\'s arguments.\"\\r\\nExtravagant as this case may appear, the King\\'s Bench of Westminster\\r\\nHall, under Mansfield and Kenyon, witnessed several not less scandalous\\r\\nand comical differences. Taking thorough pleasure in his work, Lord\\r\\nMansfield was not less industrious than impartial in the discharge of\\r\\nhis judicial functions; so long as there was anything for him to learn\\r\\nwith regard to a cause, he not only sought for it with pains but with a\\r\\nmanifest pleasure similar to that delight in judicial work which caused\\r\\nthe French Advocate, Cottu, to say of Mr. Justice Bayley: \"Il s\\'amuse à\\r\\njuger:\" but notwithstanding these good qualities, he was often culpably\\r\\ndeficient in respect for the opinions of his subordinate coadjutors. At\\r\\ntimes a vain desire to impress on the minds of spectators that his\\r\\nintellect was the paramount power of the bench; at other times a\\r\\npersonal dislike to one of his _puisnes_ caused him to derogate from the\\r\\ndignity of his court, in cases where he was especially careful to\\r\\nprotect the interests of suitors. With silence more disdainful than any\\r\\nwords could have been, he used to turn away from Mr. Justice Willes, at\\r\\nthe moment when the latter expected his chief to ask his opinion; and on\\r\\nsuch occasions the indignant _puisne_ seldom had the prudence and nerve\\r\\nto conceal his mortification. \"I have not been consulted, and I will be\\r\\nheard!\" he once shrieked forth in a paroxysm of rage caused by\\r\\nMansfield\\'s contemptuous treatment; and forty years afterwards Jeremy\\r\\nBentham, who was a witness of the insult and its effect, observed: \"At\\r\\nthis distance of time--five-and-thirty or forty years--the feminine\\r\\nscream issuing out of his manly frame still tingles in my ears.\"\\r\\nMansfield\\'s overbearing demeanor to his _puisnes_ was reproduced with\\r\\nless dignity by his successor; but Buller, the judge who wore ermine\\r\\nwhilst he was still in his thirty-third year, and who confessed that his\\r\\n\"idea of heaven was to sit at Nisi Prius all day, and to play whist all\\r\\nnight,\" seized the first opportunity to give Taffy Kenyon a lesson in\\r\\ngood manners by stating, with impressive self-possession and convincing\\r\\nlogic, the reasons which induced him to think the judgment delivered by\\r\\nhis chief to be altogether bad in law and argument.\\r\\n\\r\\n[30] One of Jekyll\\'s best displays of brilliant impudence was\\r\\nperpetrated on a Welsh judge, who was alike notorious for his greed of\\r\\noffice and his want of personal cleanliness. \"My dear sir,\" Jekyll\\r\\nobserved in his most amiable manner to this most unamiable personage,\\r\\n\"you have asked the minister for almost everything else, why _don\\'t_ you\\r\\nask him for a piece of soap and a nail-brush?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\r\\n\\r\\nWITS IN \\'SILK\\' AND PUNSTERS IN \\'ERMINE.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst Lord Camden held the chiefship of the Common Pleas, he was\\r\\nwalking with his friend Lord Dacre on the outskirts of an Essex village,\\r\\nwhen they passed the parish stocks. \"I wonder,\" said the Chief Justice,\\r\\n\"whether a man in the stocks endures a punishment that is physically\\r\\npainful? I am inclined to think that, apart from the sense of\\r\\nhumiliation and other mental anguish, the prisoner suffers nothing,\\r\\nunless the populace express their satisfaction at his fate by pelting\\r\\nhim with brick-bats.\" \"Suppose you settle your doubts by putting your\\r\\nfeet into the holes,\" rejoined Lord Dacre, carelessly. In a trice the\\r\\nChief Justice was sitting on the ground with his feet some fifteen\\r\\ninches above the level of his seat, and his ankles encircled by hard\\r\\nwood. \"Now, Dacre!\" he exclaimed, enthusiastically, \"fasten the bolts,\\r\\nand leave me for ten minutes.\" Like a courteous host Lord Dacre complied\\r\\nwith the whim of his guest, and having placed it beyond his power to\\r\\nliberate himself bade him \\'farewell\\' for ten minutes. Intending to\\r\\nsaunter along the lane and return at the expiration of the stated\\r\\nperiod, Lord Dacre moved away, and falling into one of his customary\\r\\nfits of reverie, soon forgot all about the stocks, his friend\\'s freak,\\r\\nand his friend. In the meantime the Chief Justice went through every\\r\\ntorture of an agonizing punishment--acute shootings along the confined\\r\\nlimbs, aching in the feet, angry pulsations under the toes, violent\\r\\ncramps in the muscles and thighs, gnawing pain at the point where his\\r\\nperson came in immediate contact with the cold ground, pins-and-needles\\r\\neverywhere. Amongst the various forms of his physical discomfort,\\r\\nfaintness, fever, giddiness, and raging thirst may be mentioned. He\\r\\nimplored a peasant to liberate him, and the fellow answered with a shout\\r\\nof derision; he hailed a passing clergyman, and explained that he was\\r\\nnot a culprit, but Lord Camden, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and\\r\\none of Lord Dacre\\'s guests. \"Ah!\" observed the man of cloth, not so much\\r\\nanswering the wretched culprit as passing judgment on his case, \"mad\\r\\nwith liquor. Yes, drunkenness is sadly on the increase; \\'tis droll,\\r\\nthough, for a drunkard in the stocks to imagine himself a Chief\\r\\nJustice!\" and on he passed. A farmer\\'s wife jogged by on her pillion,\\r\\nand hearing the wretched man exclaim that he should die of thirst, the\\r\\ngood creature gave him a juicy apple, and hoped that his punishment\\r\\nwould prove for the good of his soul. Not ten minutes, but ten hours did\\r\\nthe Chief Justice sit in the stocks, and when at length he was carried\\r\\ninto Lord Dacre\\'s house, he was in no humor to laugh at his own\\r\\nmiserable plight. Not long afterwards he presided at a trial in which a\\r\\nworkman brought an action against a magistrate who had wrongfully placed\\r\\nhim in the stocks. The counsel for the defence happening to laugh at the\\r\\nstatement of the plaintiff, who maintained that he had suffered intense\\r\\npain during his confinement, Lord Camden leaned forwards and inquired in\\r\\na whisper, \"Brother were you ever in the stocks?\" \"Never, my lord,\"\\r\\nanswered the advocate, with a look of lively astonishment \"I have been,\"\\r\\nwas the whispered reply; \"and let me assure you that the agony inflicted\\r\\nby the stocks is--_awful_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf a different sort, but scarcely less intense, was the pain endured by\\r\\nLord Mansfield whenever a barrister pronounced a Latin word with a false\\r\\nquantity. \"My lords,\" said the Scotch advocate, Crosby, at the bar of\\r\\nthe House of Lords, \"I have the honor to appear before your lordships as\\r\\ncounsel for the Curators.\" \"Ugh!\" groaned the Westminster Oxford\\r\\nlaw-lord, softening his reproof by an allusion to his Scotch\\r\\nnationality, \"Curators, Mr. Crosby, Curators: I wish _our_ countrymen\\r\\nwould pay a little more attention to prosody.\" \"My Lord,\" replied Mr.\\r\\nCrosby, with delightful readiness and composure, \"I can assure you that\\r\\n_our_ countrymen are very proud of your lordship as the greatest\\r\\nsenator and orator of the present age.\" The barrister who made Baron\\r\\nAlderson shudder under his robes by applying for a \\'nolle prosequi,\\' was\\r\\nnot equally quick at self-defence, when that judge interposed, \"Stop,\\r\\nsir--consider that this is the last day of term, and don\\'t make things\\r\\nunnecessarily long.\" It was Baron Alderson who, in reply to the\\r\\njuryman\\'s confession that he was deaf in one ear, observed, \"Then leave\\r\\nthe box before the trial begins; for it is necessary that jurymen should\\r\\n_hear both sides_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst legal wits, Lord Ellenborough enjoys a high place; and though in\\r\\ndealing out satire upon barristers and witnesses, and even on his\\r\\njudicial coadjutors, he was often needlessly severe, he seldom\\r\\nperpetrated a jest the force of which lay solely in its cruelty. Perhaps\\r\\nthe most harsh and reprehensible outburst of satiric humor recorded of\\r\\nhim is the crushing speech by which he ruined a young man for life. \"The\\r\\n_unfortunate_ client for whom it is my privilege to appear,\" said a\\r\\nyoung barrister, making his first essay in Westminster Hall--\"the\\r\\nunfortunate client, my lord, for whom I appear--hem! hem!--I say, my\\r\\nlord, my _unfortunate client_----\" Leaning forwards, and speaking in a\\r\\nsoft, cooing voice, that was all the more derisive, because it was so\\r\\ngentle, Lord Ellenborough said, \"you may go on, sir--so far the court is\\r\\nwith you.\" One would have liked his lordship better had he sacrificed\\r\\nhis jest to humanity, and acted as long afterwards that true gentleman,\\r\\nMr. Justice Talfourd, acted, who, seeing a young barrister overpowered\\r\\nwith nervousness, gave him time to recover himself by saying, in the\\r\\nkindest possible manner, \"Excuse me for interrupting you--but for a\\r\\nminute I am not at liberty to pay you attention.\" Whereupon the Judge\\r\\ntook up his pen and wrote a short note to a friend. Before the note was\\r\\nfinished, the young barrister had completely recovered his\\r\\nself-possession, and by an admirable speech secured a verdict for his\\r\\nclient. A highly nervous man, he might on that day have been broken for\\r\\nlife, like Ellenborough\\'s victim, by mockery; but fortunate in appearing\\r\\nbefore a judge whose witty tongue knew not how to fashion unkind words,\\r\\nhe triumphed over his temporary weakness, and has since achieved well\\r\\ndeserved success in his profession. Talfourd might have made a jest for\\r\\nthe thoughtless to laugh at; but he preferred to do an act, on which\\r\\nthose who loved him like to think.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Preston, the great conveyancer, gravely informed the judges of the\\r\\nKing\\'s Bench that \"an estate in fee simple was the highest estate known\\r\\nto the law of England,\" Lord Ellenborough checked the great Chancery\\r\\nlawyer, and said with politest irony, \"Stay, stay, Mr. Preston, let me\\r\\ntake that down. An estate\" (the judge writing as he spoke) \"in fee\\r\\nsimple is--the highest estate--known to--the law of England. Thank you,\\r\\nMr. Preston! The court, sir, is much indebted to you for the\\r\\ninformation.\" Having inflicted on the court an unspeakably dreary\\r\\noration, Preston, towards the close of the day, asked when it would be\\r\\ntheir lordship\\'s pleasure to hear the remainder of his argument;\\r\\nwhereupon Lord Ellenborough uttered a sigh of resignation, and answered,\\r\\n\\'We are bound to hear you, and we will endeavor to give you our\\r\\nundivided attention on Friday next; but as for _pleasure_, that, sir,\\r\\nhas been long out of the question.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably mistelling an old story, and taking to himself the merit of\\r\\nLord Ellenborough\\'s reply to Preston, Sir Vicary Gibbs (Chief of the\\r\\nCommon Pleas) used to tell his friends that Sergeant Vaughan--the\\r\\nsergeant who, on being subsequently raised to the bench through the\\r\\ninfluence of his elder brother, Sir Henry Halford, the court physician,\\r\\nwas humorously described by the wits of Westminster Hall as a judge _by\\r\\nprescription_--once observed in a grandiose address to the Judges of the\\r\\nCommon Pleas, \"For though our law takes cognizance of divers different\\r\\nestates, I may be permitted to say, without reserve or qualification of\\r\\nany kind, that the highest estate known to the law of England is an\\r\\nestate in fee simple.\" Whereupon Sir Vicary, according to his own\\r\\naccount, interrupted the sergeant with an air of incredulity and\\r\\nastonishment. \"What is your proposition, brother Vaughan? Perhaps I did\\r\\nnot hear you rightly!\" Flustered by the interruption, which completely\\r\\neffected its object, the sergeant explained, \"My lord, I mean to contend\\r\\nthat an estate in fee simple is _one of the highest estates_ known to\\r\\nthe law of England, that is, my lord, that it may be under certain\\r\\ncircumstances--and sometimes is so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding his high reputation for wit, Lord Ellenborough would\\r\\ndeign to use the oldest jests. Thus of Mr. Caldecott, who over and over\\r\\nagain, with dull verbosity, had said that certain limestone quarries,\\r\\nlike lead and copper mines, \"were not rateable, because the limestone\\r\\ncould only be reached by boring, which was matter of science,\" he\\r\\ngravely inquired, \"Would you, Mr. Caldecott, have us believe that every\\r\\nkind of _boring_ is matter of science?\" With finer humor he nipped in\\r\\nthe bud one of Randle Jackson\\'s flowery harangues. \"My lords,\" said the\\r\\norator, with nervous intonation, \"in the book of nature it is\\r\\nwritten----\" \"Be kind enough, Mr. Jackson,\" interposed Lord\\r\\nEllenborough, \"to mention the page from which you are about to quote.\"\\r\\nThis calls to mind the ridicule which, at an earlier period of his\\r\\ncareer, he cast on Sheridan for saying at the trial of Warren Hastings,\\r\\n\"The treasures in the Zenana of the Begum are offerings laid by the\\r\\nhand of piety on the altar of a saint.\" To this not too rhetorical\\r\\nstatement, Edward Law, as leading counsel for Warren Hastings, replied\\r\\nby asking, \"how the lady was to be considered a saint, and how the\\r\\ncamels were to be laid upon the altar?\" With greater pungency, Sheridan\\r\\ndefended himself by saying, \"This is the first time in my life that I\\r\\never heard of special pleading on a metaphor, or a bill of indictment\\r\\nagainst a trope; but such is the turn of the learned gentleman\\'s mind,\\r\\nthat when he attempts to be humorous no jest can be found, and when\\r\\nserious no fact is visible.\"[31] To the last Law delighted to point the\\r\\nabsurdities of orators who in aiming at the sublime only achieved the\\r\\nridiculous. \"My lords,\" said Mr. Gaselee, arguing that mourning coaches\\r\\nat a funeral were not liable to post-horse duty, \"it never could have\\r\\nbeen the intention of a Christian legislature to aggravate the grief\\r\\nwhich mourners endure whilst following to the grave the remains of their\\r\\ndearest relatives, by compelling them at the same time to pay the\\r\\nhorse-duty.\" Had Mr. Gaselee been a humorist, Lord Ellenborough would\\r\\nhave laughed; but as the advocate was well known to have no turn for\\r\\nraillery, the Chief Justice gravely observed, \"Mr. Gaselee, you incur\\r\\ndanger by sailing in high sentimental latitudes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the surgeon in the witness-box who said, \"I employ myself as a\\r\\nsurgeon,\" Lord Ellenborough retorted, \"But does anybody else employ you\\r\\nas a surgeon?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe demand to be examined _on affirmation_ being preferred by a Quaker\\r\\nwitness, whose dress was so much like the costume of an ordinary\\r\\n_conformist_ that the officer of the court had begun to administer the\\r\\nusual oath, Lord Ellenborough inquired of the \\'friend,\\' \"Do you really\\r\\nmean to impose upon the court by appearing here in the disguise of a\\r\\nreasonable being?\" Very pungent was his ejaculation at a cabinet dinner\\r\\nwhen he heard that Lord Kenyon was about to close his penurious old age\\r\\nby dying. \"Die!--why should he die?--what would he get by that?\"\\r\\ninterposed Lord Ellenborough, adding to the pile of jests by which men\\r\\nhave endeavored to keep a grim, unpleasant subject out of sight--a pile\\r\\nto which the latest _mot_ was added the other day by Lord Palmerston,\\r\\nwho during his last attack of gout exclaimed playfully. \"_Die_, my dear\\r\\ndoctor! That\\'s the _last_ thing I think of doing.\" Having jested about\\r\\nKenyon\\'s parsimony, as the old man lay _in extremis_, Ellenborough\\r\\nplaced another joke of the same kind upon his coffin. Hearing that\\r\\nthrough the blunder of an illiterate undertaker the motto on Kenyon\\'s\\r\\nhatchment in Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields had been painted \\'_Mors Janua Vita_,\\'\\r\\ninstead of \\'Mors Janua Vitæ,\\' he exclaimed, \"Bless you, there\\'s no\\r\\nmistake; Kenyon\\'s will directed that it should be \\'Vita,\\' so that his\\r\\nestate might be saved the expense of _a diphthong._\" Capital also was\\r\\nhis reply when Erskine urged him to accept the Great Seal. \"How can\\r\\nyou,\" he asked, in a tone of solemn entreaty, \"wish me to accept the\\r\\noffice of Chancellor, when you know, Erskine, that I am as ignorant of\\r\\nits duties as you are yourself?\" At the time of uttering these words,\\r\\nEllenborough was well aware that if he declined them Erskine would take\\r\\nthe seals. Some of his puns were very poor. For instance, his\\r\\nexclamation, \"Cite to me the decisions of the judges of the land: not\\r\\nthe judgments of the Chief Justice of Ely, who is fit only to _rule_ a\\r\\ncopybook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the best \\'legal\\' puns on record is unanimously attributed by the\\r\\ngossipers of Westminster Hall to Lord Chelmsford. As Sir Frederick\\r\\nThesiger he was engaged in the conduct of a cause, and objected to the\\r\\nirregularity of a learned sergeant who in examining his witnesses\\r\\nrepeatedly put leading questions. \"I have a right,\" maintained the\\r\\nsergeant, doggedly, \"to _deal_ with my witnesses as I please.\" \"To that\\r\\nI offer no objection,\" retorted Sir Frederick; \"you may _deal_ as you\\r\\nlike, but you shan\\'t _lead_.\" Of the same brilliant conversationalist\\r\\nMr. Grantley Berkeley has recorded a good story in \\'My Life and\\r\\nRecollections.\\' Walking down St. James\\'s Street, Lord Chelmsford was\\r\\naccosted by a stranger, who exclaimed \"Mr. Birch I believe?\" \"If you\\r\\nbelieve that, sir, you\\'ll believe anything,\" replied the ex-Chancellor,\\r\\nas he passed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Thelwall, instead of regarding his advocate with grateful silence,\\r\\ninsisted on interrupting him with vexatious remarks and impertinent\\r\\ncriticisms, Erskine neither threw up his brief nor lost his temper, but\\r\\nretorted with an innocent flash of merriment. To a slip of paper on\\r\\nwhich the prisoner had written, \"I\\'ll be hanged if I don\\'t plead my own\\r\\ncause,\" he contented himself with returning answer, \"You\\'ll be hanged if\\r\\nyou do.\" His _mots_ were often excellent, but it was the tone and joyous\\r\\nanimation of the speaker that gave them their charm. It is said that in\\r\\nhis later years, when his habitual loquaciousness occasionally sank into\\r\\ngarrulity, he used to repeat his jests with imprudent frequency,\\r\\nshamelessly giving his companions the same pun with each course of a\\r\\nlong dinner. There is a story that after his retirement from public life\\r\\nhe used morning after morning to waylay visitors on their road through\\r\\nthe garden to his house, and, pointing to his horticultural attire and\\r\\nthe spade in his hand assure them that he was \\'enjoying his otium cum\\r\\n_digging a tatie_.\\' Indeed the tradition lives that before his fall from\\r\\nthe woolsack, pert juniors used to lay bets as to the number of times he\\r\\ncould fire off a favorite old pun in the course of a sitting in the\\r\\nCourt of Chancery, and that wily leaders habitually strove to catch his\\r\\nfavor by giving him opportunities for facetious interruptions during\\r\\ntheir arguments. If such traditions be truthful, it is no matter for\\r\\nsurprise that Erskine\\'s court-jokes have come down to us with so many\\r\\nvariations. For instance, it is recorded with much circumstantiality\\r\\nthat on circuit, accosting a junior who had lost his portmanteau from\\r\\nthe back of a post-chaise, he said, with mock gravity, \"Young gentlemen,\\r\\nhenceforth imitate the elephant, the wisest of animals, who always\\r\\n_carries his trunk before him_;\" and on equally good authority it is\\r\\nstated that when Polito, the keeper of the Exeter \\'Change Menagerie, met\\r\\nwith a similar accident and brought an action for damages against the\\r\\nproprietor of the coach from the hind-boot of which his property had\\r\\ndisappeared, Erskine, speaking for the defence, told the jury that they\\r\\nwould not be justified in giving a verdict favorable to the man, who,\\r\\nthough he actually possessed an elephant, had neglected to imitate its\\r\\nprudent example and carry his trunk before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a _littérateur_ Erskine met with meagre success; but some of his\\r\\nsquibs and epigrams are greatly above the ordinary level of \\'_vers de\\r\\nsociété_.\\' For instance this is his:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"DE QUODAM REGE.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"I may not do right, though I ne\\'er can do wrong;\\r\\n   I never can die, though I can not live long;\\r\\n   My jowl it is purple, my hand it is fat--\\r\\n   Come, riddle my riddle. What is it? _What? What?_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liveliest illustrations of Erskine\\'s proverbial egotism are the\\r\\nsquibs of political caricaturists; and from their humorous\\r\\nexaggerations it is difficult to make a correct estimate of the lengths\\r\\nof absurdity to which his intellectual vanity and self-consciousness\\r\\nsometimes carried him. From what is known of his disposition it seems\\r\\nprobable that the sarcasms aimed by public writers at his infirmity\\r\\ninclined him to justify their attacks rather than to disprove them by\\r\\nhis subsequent demeanor, and that some of his most extravagant outbursts\\r\\nof self-assertion were designed in a spirit of bravado and reckless\\r\\ngood-nature to increase the laughter which satirists had raised against\\r\\nhim. However this may be, his conduct drew upon him blows that would\\r\\nhave ruffled the composure of any less self-complacent or less amiable\\r\\nman. The Tory prints habitually spoke of him as Counsellor Ego whilst he\\r\\nwas at the bar; and when it was known that he had accepted the seals,\\r\\nthe opposition journals announced that he would enter the house as\\r\\n\"Baron Ego, of Eye, in the county of Suffolk.\" Another of his nicknames\\r\\nwas _Lord Clackmannan_; and Cobbett published the following notice of an\\r\\nharangue made by the fluent advocate in the House of Commons:--\"Mr.\\r\\nErskine delivered a most animated speech in the House of Commons on the\\r\\ncauses and consequences of the late war, which lasted thirteen hours,\\r\\neighteen minutes, and a second, by Mr. John Nichol\\'s stop-watch. Mr.\\r\\nErskine closed his speech with a dignified climax: \\'I was born free,\\r\\nand, by G-d, I\\'ll remain so!\\'--[A loud cry of \\'_Hear! hear_\\' in the\\r\\ngallery, in which were citizens Tallien and Barrère.] On Monday three\\r\\nweeks we shall have the extreme satisfaction of laying before the public\\r\\na brief analysis of the above speech, our letter-founder having entered\\r\\ninto an engagement to furnish a fresh font of I\\'s.\"[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the days of Wriothesley, who may be regarded as the most\\r\\nconspicuous and unquestionable instance of judicial incompetency in the\\r\\nannals of English lawyers, the multitudes have always delighted in\\r\\nstories that illustrate the ignorance and incapacity of men who are\\r\\npresumed to possess, by right of their office, an extraordinary share of\\r\\nknowledge and wisdom. What law-student does not rub his hands as he\\r\\nreads of Lord St. John\\'s trouble during term whilst he held the seals,\\r\\nand of the impatience with which he looked forward to the long vacation,\\r\\nwhen he would not be required to look wise and speak authoritatively\\r\\nabout matters concerning which he was totally ignorant. Delicious are\\r\\nthe stories of Francis Bacon\\'s clerical successor, who endeavored to get\\r\\nup a _quantum suff_. of Chancery law by falling on his knees and asking\\r\\nenlightenment of Heaven. Gloomily comical are the anecdotes of Chief\\r\\nJustice Fleming, whose most famous and disastrous blunder was his\\r\\njudgment in Bates\\'s case. Great fun may be gathered from the tales that\\r\\nexemplify the ignorance of law which characterized the military, and\\r\\nalso the non-military laymen, who helped to take care of the seals\\r\\nduring the civil troubles of the seventeenth century. Capital is Roger\\r\\nNorth\\'s picture of Bob Wright\\'s ludicrous shiftlessness whenever the\\r\\ninfluence of his powerful relations brought the loquacious, handsome,\\r\\nplausible fellow a piece of business. \"He was a comely fellow,\" says\\r\\nRoger North, speaking of the Chief Justice Wright\\'s earlier days, \"airy\\r\\nand flourishing both in his habits and way of living; and his relation\\r\\nWren (being a powerful man in those parts) set him in credit with the\\r\\ncountry; but withal, he was so poor a lawyer that he used to bring such\\r\\ncases as came to him to his friend Mr. North, and he wrote the opinion\\r\\non the paper, and the lawyer copied it, and signed under the case as if\\r\\nit had been his own. It ran so low with him that when Mr. North was at\\r\\nLondon he sent up his cases to him, and had opinions returned by the\\r\\npost; and, in the meantime he put off his clients on pretence of taking\\r\\nthe matter into serious consideration.\" Perhaps some readers of this\\r\\npage can point to juniors of the present date whose professional\\r\\nincapacity closely resembles the incompetence of this gay young\\r\\nbarrister of Charles II.\\'s time. Laughter again rises at the thought of\\r\\nLord Chancellor Bathurst and the judicial perplexities and blunders\\r\\nwhich caused Sir Charles Williams to class him with those who\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Were cursed and stigmatized by power,\\r\\n     And rais\\'d to be expos\\'d.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch more than an average or altogether desirable amount of amiability\\r\\nhas fallen to the reader who can refrain from a malicious smile, when he\\r\\nis informed by reliable history that Lord Loughborough (no mean lawyer\\r\\nor inefficient judge), gave utterance to so much bad law, as Chairman of\\r\\nQuarter Sessions in canny Yorkshire, that when on appeal his decisions\\r\\nwere reversed with many polite expressions of _sincere_ regret by the\\r\\nKing\\'s Bench, all Westminster Hall laughed in concert at the mistakes of\\r\\nthe sagacious Chief of the Common Pleas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no lawyer, brilliant or dull, has been more widely ridiculed for\\r\\nincompetence than Erskine. Sir Causticus Witherett, being asked some\\r\\nyears since why a certain Chancellor, unjustly accused of intellectual\\r\\ndimness by his political adversaries and by the uninformed public,\\r\\npreferred his seat amongst the barons to his official place on the\\r\\nwoolsack, is said to have replied: \"The Lord Chancellor usually takes\\r\\nhis seat amongst the peers whenever he can do so with propriety, because\\r\\nhe is a highly nervous man, and when he is on the woolsack, he is apt to\\r\\nbe frightened at finding himself all alone--_in the dark_.\" As soon as\\r\\nErskine was mentioned as a likely person to be Lord Chancellor, rumors\\r\\nbegan to circulate concerning his total unfitness for the office; and no\\r\\nsooner had he mounted the woolsack than the wits declared him to be\\r\\nalone and in the dark. Lord Ellenborough\\'s sarcasm was widely repeated,\\r\\nand gave the cue to the advocate\\'s detractors, who had little difficulty\\r\\nin persuading the public that any intelligent law-clerk would make as\\r\\ngood a Chancellor as Thomas Erskine. With less discretion than\\r\\ngood-humor, Erskine gave countenance to the representations of his\\r\\nenemies by ridiculing his own unfitness for the office. During the\\r\\ninterval between his appointment and his first appearance as judge in\\r\\nthe Court of Chancery, he made a jocose pretence of \\'reading up\\' for his\\r\\nnew duties: and whimsically exaggerating his deficiencies, he\\r\\nrepresented himself as studying books with which raw students have some\\r\\ndegree of familiarity. Caught with \\'Cruise\\'s Digest\\' of the laws\\r\\nrelating to real property, open in his hand, he observed to the visitor\\r\\nwho had interrupted his studies, \"You see, I am taking a little from my\\r\\n_cruise_ daily, without any prospect of coming to the end of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn of 1819 two gentlemen of the United States having differed\\r\\nin opinion concerning his incompetence in the Court of Chancery--the one\\r\\nof them maintaining that the greater number of his decrees had been\\r\\nreversed, and the other maintaining that so many of his decisions had\\r\\nnot endured reversal--the dispute gave rise to a bet of three dozen of\\r\\nport. With comical bad taste one of the parties to the bet--the one who\\r\\nbelieved that the Chancellor\\'s judgments had been thus frequently\\r\\nupset--wrote to Erskine for information on the point. Instead of giving\\r\\nthe answer which his correspondent desired, Erskine informed him in the\\r\\nfollowing terms that he had lost his wine:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Upper Berkley Street, Nov. 13, 1819.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"SIR:--I certainly was appointed Chancellor under the administration\\r\\n   in which Mr. Fox was Secretary of State, in 1806, and could have been\\r\\n   Chancellor under no administration in which he had not a post; nor\\r\\n   would have accepted without him any office whatsoever. I believe the\\r\\n   administration was said, by all the _Blockheads_, to be made up of\\r\\n   all the _Talents_ in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"But you have certainly lost your bet on the subject of my decrees.\\r\\n   None of them were appealed against, except one, upon a branch of Mr.\\r\\n   Thellusson\\'s will--but it was affirmed without a dissentient voice,\\r\\n   on the motion of Lord Eldon, then and now Lord Chancellor. If you\\r\\n   think I was no lawyer, you may continue to think so. It is plain you\\r\\n   are no lawyer yourself; but I wish every man to retain his opinion,\\r\\n   though at the cost of three dozen of port.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Your humble servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"ERSKINE.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"To save you from spending your money on bets which you are sure to\\r\\n   lose, remember that no man can be a great advocate who is no lawyer.\\r\\n   The thing is impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the many good stories current about chiefs of the law who are still\\r\\nalive, the present writer, for obvious reasons, abstains from taking\\r\\nnotice; but one humorous anecdote concerning a lively judge may with\\r\\npropriety be inserted in these pages, since it fell from his own lips\\r\\nwhen he was making a speech from the chair at a public dinner. Between\\r\\nsixty-five and seventy years from the present time, when Sir Frederick\\r\\nPollock was a boy at St. Paul\\'s school, he drew upon himself the\\r\\ndispleasure of Dr. Roberts, the somewhat irascible head-master of the\\r\\nschool, who frankly told Sir Frederick\\'s father, \"Sir, you\\'ll live to\\r\\nsee that boy of yours hanged.\" Years afterwards, when the boy of whom\\r\\nthis dismal prophecy was made had distinguished himself at Cambridge and\\r\\nthe bar, Dr. Roberts, meeting Sir Frederick\\'s mother in society,\\r\\noverwhelmed her with congratulations upon her son\\'s success, and\\r\\nfortunately oblivious of his former misunderstanding with his pupil,\\r\\nconcluded his polite speeches by saying--\"Ah! madam, I always said he\\'d\\r\\nfill an _elevated_ situation.\" Told by the venerable judge at a recent\\r\\ndinner of \\'Old Paulines,\\' this story was not less effective than the\\r\\nbest of those post-prandial sallies with which William St. Julien\\r\\nArabin--the Assistant Judge of Old Bailey notoriety--used to convulse\\r\\nhis auditors something more than thirty years since. In the \\'Arabiniana\\'\\r\\nit is recorded how this judge, in sentencing an unfortunate woman to a\\r\\nlong term of transportation, concluded his address with--\"You must go\\r\\nout of the country. You have disgraced _even_ your own sex.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLet this chapter close with a lawyer\\'s testimony to the moral qualities\\r\\nof his brethren. In the garden of Clement\\'s Inn may still be seen the\\r\\nstatue of a negro, supporting a sun-dial, upon which a legal wit\\r\\ninscribed the following lines:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"In vain, poor sable son of woe,\\r\\n     Thou seek\\'st the tender tear;\\r\\n   From thee in vain with pangs they flow,\\r\\n     For mercy dwells not here.\\r\\n   From cannibals thou fled\\'st in vain;\\r\\n     Lawyers less quarter give;\\r\\n   The _first_ won\\'t eat you till you\\'re _slain_,\\r\\n     The _last_ will do\\'t _alive_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately these lines have been obliterated.\\r\\n\\r\\n[31] Robert Dallas--one of Edward Law\\'s coadjutors in the defence of\\r\\nHastings--gave another \\'manager\\' a more telling blow. Indignant with\\r\\nBurke for his implacable animosity to Hastings, Dallas (subsequently\\r\\nChief Justice of the Common Pleas) wrote the stinging lines--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oft have we wondered that on Irish ground No poisonous reptile has e\\'er\\r\\nyet been found; Reveal\\'d the secret stands of nature\\'s work--She saved\\r\\nher venom to produce her Burke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[32] In the \\'Anti-Jacobin,\\' Canning, in the mock report of an imaginary\\r\\nspeech, represented Erskine as addressing the \\'Whig Club\\' thus:--\"For\\r\\nhis part he should only say that, having been, as he had been, both a\\r\\nsoldier and a sailor, if it had been his fortune to have stood in either\\r\\nof these relations to the Directory--as _a_ man and a major-general he\\r\\nshould not have scrupled to direct his artillery against the national\\r\\nrepresentatives:--as a naval officer he would undoubtedly have\\r\\nundertaken for the removal of the exiled deputies; admitting the\\r\\nexigency, under all its relations, as it appeared to him to exist, and\\r\\nthe then circumstances of the times with all their bearings and\\r\\ndependencies, branching out into an infinity of collateral\\r\\nconsiderations and involving in each a variety of objects, political,\\r\\nphysical, and moral; and these, again, under their distinct and separate\\r\\nheads, ramifying into endless subdivisions, which it was foreign to his\\r\\npurpose to consider, Mr. Erskine concluded by recapitulating, in a\\r\\nstrain of agonizing and impressive eloquence, the several more prominent\\r\\nheads of his speech; he had been a soldier and a sailor, and had a son\\r\\nat Winchester school--he had been called by special retainers, during\\r\\nthe summer, into many different and distant parts of the\\r\\ncountry--traveling chiefly in post-chaises. He felt himself called upon\\r\\nto declare that his poor faculties were at the service of his\\r\\ncountry--of the free and enlightened part of it at least. He stood there\\r\\nas a man--he stood in the eye, indeed, in the hand of God--to whom (in\\r\\nthe presence of the company and the waiters), he solemnly appealed. He\\r\\nwas of noble, perhaps royal, blood--he had a house at Hampsted--was\\r\\nconvinced of the necessity of a thorough and radical reform. His\\r\\npamphlets had gone through thirty editions, skipping alternately the odd\\r\\nand even numbers. He loved the Constitution, to which he would cling and\\r\\ngrapple--and he was clothed with the infirmities of man\\'s nature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\r\\n\\r\\nWITNESSES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days when Mr. Davenport Hill, the Recorder of Birmingham, made a\\r\\nprofessional reputation for himself in the committee-rooms of the Houses\\r\\nof Parliament, he had many a sharp tussle with one of those venal\\r\\nwitnesses who, during the period of excitement that terminated in the\\r\\ndisastrous railway panic, were ready to give scientific evidence on\\r\\nengineering questions, with less regard to truth than to the interests\\r\\nof the persons who paid for their evidence. Having by mendacious\\r\\nevidence gravely injured a cause in which Mr. Hill was interested as\\r\\ncounsel, and Mr. Tite, the eminent architect, and present member for\\r\\nBath, was concerned as a projector, this witness was struck with\\r\\napoplexy and died--before he could complete the mischief which he had so\\r\\nadroitly begun. Under the circumstances, his sudden withdrawal from the\\r\\nworld was not an occasion for universal regret. \"Well, Hill, have you\\r\\nheard the news?\" inquired Mr. Tite of the barrister, whom he encountered\\r\\nin Middle Temple Lane on the morning after the engineer\\'s death. \"Have\\r\\nyou heard that ---- died yesterday of apoplexy?\" \"I can\\'t say,\" was the\\r\\nrejoinder, \"that I shall shed many tears for his loss. He was an arrant\\r\\nscoundrel.\" \"Come, come,\" replied the architect, charitably, \"you have\\r\\nalways been too hard on that man. He was by no means so bad a fellow as\\r\\nyou would make him out. I do verily believe that in the whole course of\\r\\nhis life that man never told a lie--_out of the witness-box_.\" Strange\\r\\nto say, this comical testimony to character was quite justified by the\\r\\nfact. This man, who lied in public as a matter of business, was\\r\\npunctiliously honorable in private life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the simplest method of tampering with witnesses an instance is found\\r\\nin a case which occurred while Sir Edward Coke was Chief Justice of the\\r\\nKing\\'s Bench. Loitering about Westminster Hall, one of the parties in an\\r\\naction stumbled upon the witness whose temporary withdrawal from the\\r\\nways of men he was most anxious to effect. With a perfect perception of\\r\\nthe proper use of hospitality, he accosted this witness (a staring,\\r\\nopen-mouthed countryman), with suitable professions of friendliness, and\\r\\ncarrying him into an adjacent tavern, set him down before a bottle of\\r\\nwine. As soon as the sack had begun to quicken his guest\\'s circulation,\\r\\nthe crafty fellow hastened into court with the intelligence that the\\r\\nwitness, whom he had left drinking in a room not two hundred yards\\r\\ndistant, was in a fit and lying at death\\'s door. The court being asked\\r\\nto wait, the impudent rascal protested that to wait would be useless;\\r\\nand the Chief Justice, taking his view of the case, proceeded to give\\r\\njudgment without hearing the most important evidence in the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn badgering a witness with noisy derision, no barrister of Charles\\r\\nII.\\'s time could surpass George Jeffreys; but on more than one occasion\\r\\nthat gentleman, in his most overbearing moments, met with his master in\\r\\nthe witness whom he meant to brow-beat. \"You fellow in the leathern\\r\\ndoublet,\" he is said to have exclaimed to a countryman whom he was about\\r\\nto cross-examine, \"Pray, what are you paid for swearing?\" \"God bless\\r\\nyou, sir, and make you an honest man,\" answered the farmer, looking the\\r\\nbarrister full in the face, and speaking with a voice of hearty\\r\\ngood-humor; \"if you had no more for lying than I have for swearing, you\\r\\nwould wear a leather doublet as well as I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes Erskine\\'s treatment of witnesses was very jocular, and\\r\\nsometimes very unfair; but his jocoseness was usually so distinct from\\r\\nmere flippant derisiveness, and his unfairness was redeemed by such\\r\\ndelicacy of wit and courtesy of manner, that his most malicious _jeux\\r\\nd\\'esprit_ seldom raised the anger of the witnesses at whom they were\\r\\naimed. A religious enthusiast objecting to be sworn in the usual manner,\\r\\nbut stating that though he would not \"kiss the book,\" he would \"hold up\\r\\nhis hand\" and swear, Erskine asked him to give his reason for preferring\\r\\nso eccentric a way to the ordinary mode of giving testimony. \"It is\\r\\nwritten in the book of Revelations,\" answered the man, \"that the angel\\r\\nstanding on the sea _held up his hand_.\" \"But that does not apply to\\r\\nyour case,\" urged the advocate; \"for in the first place, you are no\\r\\nangel; secondly, you cannot tell how the angel would have sworn if he\\r\\nhad stood on dry ground, as you do.\" Not shaken by this reply, which\\r\\ncannot be called unfair, and which, notwithstanding its jocoseness, was\\r\\nexactly the answer which the gravest divine would have made to such\\r\\nscruples, the witness persisted in his position; and on being permitted\\r\\nto give evidence in his own peculiar way, he had enough influence with\\r\\nthe jury to induce them to give a verdict adverse to Erskine\\'s wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess fair but more successful was Erskine\\'s treatment of the commercial\\r\\ntraveller, who appeared in the witness box dressed in the height of\\r\\nfashion, and wearing a starched white necktie folded with the \\'Brummel\\r\\nfold.\\' In an instant reading the character of the man, on whom he had\\r\\nnever before set eyes, and knowing how necessary it was to put him in a\\r\\nstate of extreme agitation and confusion, before touching on the facts\\r\\nconcerning which he had come to give evidence, Erskine rose, surveyed\\r\\nthe coxcomb, and said, with an air of careless amusement, \"You were born\\r\\nand bred in Manchester, _I perceive_.\" Greatly astonished at this\\r\\nopening remark, the man answered, nervously, that he was \"a Manchester\\r\\nman--born and bred in Manchester.\" \"Exactly,\" observed Erskine, in a\\r\\nconversational tone, and as though he were imparting information to a\\r\\npersonal friend--\"exactly so; I knew it from the absurd tie of your\\r\\nneckcloth.\" The roars of laughter which followed this rejoinder so\\r\\ncompletely effected the speaker\\'s purpose that the confounded bagman\\r\\ncould not tell his right hand from his left. Equally effective was\\r\\nErskine\\'s sharp question, put quickly to the witness, who, in an action\\r\\nfor payment of a tailor\\'s bill, swore that a certain dress-coat was\\r\\nbadly made--one of the sleeves being longer than the other. \"You will,\"\\r\\nsaid Erskine, slowly, having risen to cross-examine, \"swear--that one of\\r\\nthe sleeves was--longer--than the other?\" _Witness._ \"I do swear it.\"\\r\\n_Erskine_, quickly, and with a flash of indignation, \"Then, sir, I am to\\r\\nunderstand that you positively deny that one of the sleeves was\\r\\n_shorter_ than the other?\" Startled into a self-contradiction by the\\r\\nsuddenness and impetuosity of this thrust, the witness said, \"I do deny\\r\\nit.\" _Erskine_, raising his voice as the tumultuous laughter died away,\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir; I don\\'t want to trouble you with another question.\" One\\r\\nof Erskine\\'s smartest puns referred to a question of evidence. \"A case,\"\\r\\nhe observed, in a speech made during his latter years, \"being laid\\r\\nbefore me by my veteran friend, the Duke of Queensbury--better known as\\r\\n\\'old Q\\'--as to whether he could sue a tradesman for breach of contract\\r\\nabout the painting of his house; and the evidence being totally\\r\\ninsufficient to support the case, I wrote thus: \\'I am of opinion that\\r\\nthis action will not _lie_ unless the witnesses _do_.\\'\" It is worthy of\\r\\nnotice that this witticism was but a revival (with a modification) of a\\r\\npun attributed to Lord Chancellor Hatton in Bacon\\'s \\'Apophthegmes.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this country many years have elapsed since duels have taken place\\r\\nbetwixt gentlemen of the long robe, or between barristers and witnesses\\r\\nin consequence of words uttered in the heat of forensic strife; but in\\r\\nthe last century, and in the opening years of the present, it was no\\r\\nvery rare occurrence for a barrister to be called upon for\\r\\n\\'satisfaction\\' by a person whom he had insulted in the course of his\\r\\nprofessional duty. During George II.\\'s reign, young Robert Henley so\\r\\nmercilessly badgered one Zephaniah Reeve, whom he had occasion to\\r\\ncross-examine in a trial at Bristol, that the infuriated witness--Quaker\\r\\nand peace-loving merchant though he was--sent his persecutor a challenge\\r\\nimmediately upon leaving court. Rather than incur the ridicule of \\'going\\r\\nout with a Quaker,\\' and the sin of shooting at a man whom he had\\r\\nactually treated with unjustifiable freedom, Henley retreated from an\\r\\nembarrassing position by making a handsome apology; and years\\r\\nafterwards, when he had risen to the woolsack, he entertained his old\\r\\nacquaintance, Zephaniah Reeve, at a fashionable dinner-party, when he\\r\\nassembled guests were greatly amused by the Lord Chancellor\\'s account of\\r\\nthe commencement of his acquaintance with his Quaker friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween thirty and forty years later Thurlow was \\'called out\\' by the\\r\\nDuke of Hamilton\\'s agent, Mr. Andrew Stewart, whom he had grievously\\r\\noffended by his conduct of the Great Douglas Case. On Jan. 14,\\r\\n1769-1770, Thurlow and his adversary met in Hyde Park. On his way to the\\r\\nappointed place, the barrister stopped at a tavern near Hyde Park\\r\\nCorner, and \"ate an enormous breakfast,\" after which preparation for\\r\\nbusiness, he hastened to the field of action. Accounts agree in saying\\r\\nthat he behaved well upon the ground. Long after the bloodless\\r\\n_rencontre_, the Scotch agent, not a little proud of his \\'affair\\' with a\\r\\nfuture Lord Chancellor, said, \"Mr. Thurlow advanced and stood up to me\\r\\nlike an elephant.\" But the elephant and the mouse parted without hurting\\r\\neach other; the encounter being thus faithfully described in the \\'Scots\\'\\r\\nMagazine:\\' \"On Sunday morning, January 14, the parties met with swords\\r\\nand pistols, in Hyde Park, one of them having for his second his\\r\\nbrother, Colonel S----, and the other having for his Mr. L----, member\\r\\nfor a city in Kent. Having discharged pistols, at ten yards\\' distance,\\r\\nwithout effect, they drew their swords, but the seconds interposed, and\\r\\nput an end to the affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the best \\'Northern Circuit stories\\' pinned upon Lord Eldon\\r\\nrelates to a challenge which an indignant suitor is said to have sent to\\r\\nLaw and John Scott. In a trial at York that arose from a horse-race, it\\r\\nwas stated in evidence that one of the conditions of the race required\\r\\nthat \"each horse should be ridden by a gentleman.\" The race having been\\r\\nrun, the holders refused to pay the stakes to the winner on the ground\\r\\nthat he was not a gentleman; whereupon the equestrian whose gentility\\r\\nwas thus called in question brought an action for the money. After a\\r\\nvery humorous inquiry, which terminated in a verdict for the defendants,\\r\\nthe plaintiff _was said_ to have challenged the defendants\\' counsel.\\r\\nMessrs. Scott and Law, for maintaining that he was no gentleman; to\\r\\nwhich invitation, it also averred, reply was made that the challengees\\r\\n\"could not think of fighting one who had been found _no gentleman_ by\\r\\nthe solemn verdict of twelve of his countrymen.\" Inquiry, however, has\\r\\ndeprived this delicious story of much of its piquancy. Eldon had no part\\r\\nin the offence; and Law, who was the sole utterer of the obnoxious\\r\\nwords, received no invitation to fight. \"No message was sent,\" says a\\r\\nwriter, supposed to be Lord Brougham, in the \\'Law Magazine,\\' \"and no\\r\\nattempt was made to provoke a breach of the peace. It is very possible\\r\\nLord Eldon may have said, and Lord Ellenborough too, that they were not\\r\\nbound to treat one in such a predicament as a gentleman, and hence the\\r\\nstory has arisen in the lady\\'s mind. The fact was as well known on the\\r\\nNorthern Circuit as the answer of a witness to a question, whether the\\r\\nparty had a right by his circumstances to keep a pack of fox-hounds; \\'No\\r\\nmore right than I to keep a pack of archbishops.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCurran is said to have received a call, before he left his bed one\\r\\nmorning, from a gentleman whom he had cross-examined with needless\\r\\ncruelty and unjustifiable insolence on the previous day. \"Sir!\" said\\r\\nthis irate man, presenting himself in Curran\\'s bedroom, and rousing the\\r\\nbarrister from slumber to a consciousness that he was in a very awkward\\r\\nposition, \"I am the gintleman whom you insulted yesterday in His\\r\\nMajesty\\'s court of justice, in the presence of the whole county, and I\\r\\nam here to thrash you soundly!\" Thus speaking, the Herculean intruder\\r\\nwaved a horsewhip over the recumbent lawyer. \"You don\\'t mean to strike a\\r\\nman when he is lying down?\" inquired Curran. \"No, bedad; I\\'ll just wait\\r\\ntill you\\'ve got out of bed and then I\\'ll give it to you sharp and fast.\"\\r\\nCurran\\'s eye twinkled mischievously as he rejoined: \"If that\\'s the case,\\r\\nby ---- I\\'ll lie here all day.\" So tickled was the visitor with this\\r\\nhumorous announcement, that he dropped his horsewhip, and dismissing\\r\\nanger with a hearty roar of laughter, asked the counsellor to shake\\r\\nhands with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the December of 1663, Pepys was present at a trial in Guildhall\\r\\nconcerning the fraud of a merchant-adventurer, who having insured his\\r\\nvessel for £2400 when, together with her cargo, she was worth no more\\r\\nthan £500, had endeavored to wreck her off the French coast. From\\r\\nPepys\\'s record it appears that this was a novel piece of rascality at\\r\\nthat time, and consequently created lively sensation in general society,\\r\\nas well as in legal and commercial coteries. \"All the great counsel in\\r\\nthe kingdom\" were employed in the cause; and though maritime causes\\r\\nthen, as now, usually involved much hard swearing, the case was notable\\r\\nfor the prodigious amount of perjury which it elicited. For the most\\r\\npart the witnesses were sailors, who, besides swearing with stolid\\r\\nindifference to truth, caused much amusement by the incoherence of their\\r\\nstatements and by their free use of nautical expressions, which were\\r\\nquite unintelligible to Chief Justice (Sir Robert) Hyde. \"It was,\" says\\r\\nPepys, \"pleasant to see what mad sort of testimonys the seamen did give,\\r\\nand could not be got to speak in order; and then their terms such as the\\r\\njudge could not understand, and to hear how sillily the counsel and\\r\\njudge would speak as to the terms necessary in the matter, would make\\r\\none laugh; and above all a Frenchman, that was forced to speak in\\r\\nFrench, and took an English oath he did not understand, and had an\\r\\ninterpreter sworn to tell us what he said, which was the best testimony\\r\\nof all.\" A century later Lord Mansfield was presiding at a trial\\r\\nconsequent upon a collision of two ships at sea, when a common sailor,\\r\\nwhilst giving testimony, said, \"At the time I was standing abaft the\\r\\nbinnacle;\" whereupon his lordship, with a proper desire to master the\\r\\nfacts of the case, observed, \"Stay, stay a minute, witness: you say\\r\\nthat at the time in question you were _standing abaft the binnacle_; now\\r\\ntell me, where is abaft the binnacle?\" This was too much for the gravity\\r\\nof \\'the salt,\\' who immediately before climbing into the witness-box had\\r\\ntaken a copious draught of neat rum. Removing his eyes from the bench,\\r\\nand turning round upon the crowded court with an expression of intense\\r\\namusement, he exclaimed at the top of his voice, \"He\\'s a pretty fellow\\r\\nfor a judge! Bless my jolly old eyes!--[the reader may substitute a\\r\\nfamiliar form of \\'imprecation on eye-sight\\']--you have got a pretty sort\\r\\nof a land-lubber for a judge! He wants me to tell him where _abaft the\\r\\nbinnacle is_!\" Not less amused than the witness, Lord Mansfield\\r\\nrejoined, \"Well, my friend, you must fit me for my office by telling me\\r\\nwhere _abaft the binnacle_ is; you\\'ve already shown me the meaning of\\r\\n_half seas over_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith less good-humor the same Chief Justice revenged himself on Dr.\\r\\nBrocklesby, who, whilst standing in the witness-box of the Court of King\\'s\\r\\nBench, incurred the Chief Justice\\'s displeasure by referring to their\\r\\nprivate intercourse. Some accounts say that the medical witness merely\\r\\nnodded to the Chief Justice, as he might have done with propriety had they\\r\\nbeen taking seats at a convivial table; other accounts, with less\\r\\nappearance of probability, maintain that in a voice audible to the bar, he\\r\\nreminded the Chief Justice of certain jolly hours which they had spent\\r\\ntogether during the previous evening. Anyhow, Lord Mansfield was hurt, and\\r\\nshowed his resentment in his \\'summing-up\\' by thus addressing the Jury:\\r\\n\"The next witness is one _R_ocklesby, or _B_rocklesby--_B_rocklesby or\\r\\n_R_ocklesby, I am not sure which; and first, _he swears that he is a\\r\\nphysician_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one occasion Lord Mansfield covered his retreat from an untenable\\r\\nposition with a sparkling pleasantry. An old witness named _Elm_ having\\r\\ngiven his evidence with remarkable clearness, although he was more than\\r\\neighty years of age, Lord Mansfield examined him as to his habitual mode\\r\\nof living, and found that he had throughout life been an early riser and\\r\\na singularly temperate man. \"Ay,\" observed the Chief Justice, in a tone\\r\\nof approval, \"I have always found that without temperance and early\\r\\nhabits, longevity is never attained.\" The next witness, the _elder_\\r\\nbrother of this model of temperance, was then called, and he almost\\r\\nsurpassed his brother as an intelligent and clear-headed utterer of\\r\\nevidence. \"I suppose,\" observed Lord Mansfield, \"that you also are an\\r\\nearly riser.\" \"No, my lord,\" answered the veteran, stoutly; \"I like my\\r\\nbed at all hours, and special-_lie_ I like it of a morning.\" \"Ah; but,\\r\\nlike your brother, you are a very temperate man?\" quickly asked the\\r\\njudge, looking out anxiously for the safety of the more important part\\r\\nof his theory. \"My lord,\" responded this ancient Elm, disdaining to\\r\\nplead guilty to a charge of habitual sobriety, \"I am a very old man, and\\r\\nmy memory is as clear as a bell, but I can\\'t remember the night when\\r\\nI\\'ve gone to bed without being more or less drunk.\" Lord Mansfield was\\r\\nsilent. \"Ah, my lord,\" Mr. Dunning exclaimed, \"this old man\\'s case\\r\\nsupports a theory upheld by many persons, that habitual intemperance is\\r\\nfavorable to longevity.\" \"No, no,\" replied the Chief Justice, with a\\r\\nsmile, \"this old man and his brother merely teach us what every\\r\\ncarpenter knows--that Elm, whether it be wet or dry, is a very tough\\r\\nwood.\" Another version of this excellent story makes Lord Mansfield\\r\\ninquire of the elder Elm, \"Then how do you account for your prolonged\\r\\ntenure of existence?\" to which question Elm is made to respond, more\\r\\nlike a lawyer than a simple witness, \"I account for it by the terms of\\r\\nthe original lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFew stories relating to witnesses are more laughable than that which\\r\\ndescribes the arithmetical process by which Mr. Baron Perrot arrived at\\r\\nthe value of certain conflicting evidence. \"Gentlemen of the jury,\" this\\r\\njudge is reported to have said, in summing up the evidence in a trial\\r\\nwhere the witnesses had sworn with noble tenacity of purpose, \"there are\\r\\nfifteen witnesses who swear that the watercourse used to flow in a ditch\\r\\non the north side of the hedge. On the other hand, gentlemen, there are\\r\\nnine witnesses who swear that the watercourse used to flow on the south\\r\\nside of the hedge. Now, gentlemen, if you subtract nine from fifteen,\\r\\nthere remain six witnesses wholly uncontradicted; and I recommend you to\\r\\ngive your verdict for the party who called those six witnesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhichever of the half-dozen ways in which it is told be accepted as the\\r\\nright one, the following story exemplifies the difficulty which\\r\\noccasionally arises in courts of justice, when witnesses use provincial\\r\\nterms with which the judge is not familiar. Mr. William Russell, in past\\r\\ndays deputy-surveyor of \\'canny Newcastle,\\' and a genuine Northumbrian in\\r\\ndialect, brogue, and shrewdness, was giving his evidence at an important\\r\\ntrial in the Newcastle court-house, when he said--\"As I was going along\\r\\nthe quay, I saw a hubbleshew coming out of a chare-foot.\" Not aware that\\r\\non Tyne-side the word \\'hubbleshew\\' meant \\'a concourse of riotous\\r\\npersons;\\' that the narrow alleys or lanes of Newcastle \\'old town\\' were\\r\\ncalled by their inhabitants \\'chares;\\' and that the lower end of each\\r\\nalley, where it opened upon quay-side, was termed a \\'chare-foot;\\' the\\r\\njudge, seeing only one part of the puzzle, inquired the meaning of the\\r\\nword \\'hubbleshew.\\' \"A crowd of disorderly persons,\" answered the\\r\\ndeputy-surveyor. \"And you mean to say,\" inquired the judge of assize,\\r\\nwith a voice and look of surprise, \"that you saw a crowd of people come\\r\\nout of a chair-foot?\" \"I do, my lord,\" responded the witness.\\r\\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" said his lordship, turning to the \\'twelve good\\r\\nmen\\' in the box, \"it must be needless for me to inform you--_that this\\r\\nwitness is insane_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report of a trial which occurred at Newcastle Assizes towards the\\r\\nclose of the last century gives the following succession of questions\\r\\nand answers:--_Barrister._--\"What is your name?\" _Witness._--\"Adam,\\r\\nsir--Adam Thompson.\" _Barrister._--\"Where do you live?\" _Witness._--\"In\\r\\nParadise.\" _Barrister_ (with facetious tone).--\"And pray, Mr. Adam, how\\r\\nlong have you dwelt in Paradise?\" _Witness._--\"Ever since the flood.\"\\r\\nParadise is the name of a village in the immediate vicinity of\\r\\nNewcastle; and \\'the flood\\' referred to by the witness was the inundation\\r\\n(memorable in local annals) of the Tyne, which in the year 1771 swept\\r\\naway the old Tyne Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nCIRCUITEERS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExposed to some of the discomforts, if not all the dangers,[33] of\\r\\ntravel; required to ride over black and cheerless tracts of moor and\\r\\nheath: now belated in marshy districts, and now exchanging shots with\\r\\ngentlemen of the road; sleeping, as luck favored them, in way-side\\r\\ntaverns, country mansions, or the superior hotels of provincial\\r\\ntowns--the circuiteers of olden time found their advantage in\\r\\ncultivating social hilarity and establishing an etiquette that\\r\\nencouraged good-fellowship in their itinerant societies. At an early\\r\\ndate they are found varying the monotony of cross-country rides with\\r\\nracing-matches and drinking bouts, cock-fights and fox-hunting; and\\r\\nenlivening assize towns and country houses with balls and plays, frolic\\r\\nand song. A prodigious amount of feasting was perpetrated on an ordinary\\r\\ncircuit-round of the seventeenth century; and at circuit-messes, judges\\'\\r\\ndinners, and sheriffs\\' banquets, saucy juniors were allowed a license of\\r\\nspeech to staid leaders and grave dignitaries that was altogether\\r\\nexceptional to the prevailing tone of manners.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days when Chief Justice Hyde, Clarendon\\'s cousin, used to ride\\r\\nthe Norfolk Circuit, old Sergeant Earl was the leader, or, to use the\\r\\nslang of the period, \\'cock of the round\\'. A keen, close-fisted, tough\\r\\npractitioner, this sergeant used to ride from town to town, chuckling\\r\\nover the knowledge that he was earning more and spending less than any\\r\\nother member of the circuit. One biscuit was all the refreshment which\\r\\nhe permitted himself on the road from Cambridge to Norwich; although he\\r\\nconsented to dismount at the end of every ten miles to stretch his\\r\\nlimbs. Sidling up to Sergeant Earl, as there was no greater man for him\\r\\nto toady, Francis North offered himself as the old man\\'s travelling\\r\\ncompanion from the university to the manufacturing town; and when Earl\\r\\nwith a grim smile accepted the courteous suggestion, the young man\\r\\ncongratulated himself. On the following morning, however, he had reason\\r\\nto question his good fortune when the sergeant\\'s clerk brought him a\\r\\ncake, and remarked, significantly, \"Put it in your pocket, sir; you\\'ll\\r\\nwant it; for my master won\\'t draw bit till he comes to Norwich.\" It was\\r\\na hard day\\'s work; but young Frank North was rewarded for his civility\\r\\nto the sergeant, who condescended to instruct his apt pupil in the\\r\\ntricks and chicaneries of their profession. \"Sir,\" inquired North at the\\r\\nclose of the excursion, emboldened by the rich man\\'s affability, \"by\\r\\nwhat system do you keep your accounts, which must be very complex, as\\r\\nyou have lands, securities, and great comings-in of all kinds?\"\\r\\n\"Accounts! boy,\" answered the grey-headed curmudgeon; \"I get as much as\\r\\nI can, and I spend as little as I can; that\\'s how I keep my accounts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen North had raised himself to the Chiefship of the Common Pleas he\\r\\nchose the Western Circuit, \"not for the common cause, it being a long\\r\\ncircuit, and beneficial for the officers and servants, but because he\\r\\nknew the gentlemen to be loyal and conformable, and that he should have\\r\\nfair quarter amongst them;\" and so much favor did he win amongst the\\r\\nloyal and conformable gentry that old Bishop Mew--the prelate of\\r\\nWinchester, popularly known as Bishop _Patch_, because he always wore a\\r\\npatch of black court-plaster over the scar of a wound which he received\\r\\non one of his cheeks, whilst fighting as a trooper for Charles I.--used\\r\\nto term him the \"Deliciæ occidentis, or Darling of the West.\" On one\\r\\noccasion this Darling of the West was placed in a ludicrous position by\\r\\nthe alacrity with which he accepted an invitation from \"a busy fanatic,\"\\r\\na Devonshire gentleman, of good family, and estate, named Duke. This\\r\\n\"busy fanatic\" invited the judges on circuit and their officers to dine\\r\\nand sleep at his mansion on their way to Exeter, and subsequently\\r\\nscandalized his guests--all of them of course zealous defenders of the\\r\\nEstablished Church--by reading family-prayers before supper. \"The\\r\\ngentleman,\" says the historian, \"had not the manners to engage the\\r\\nparish minister to come and officiate with any part of the evening\\r\\nservice before supper: but he himself got behind the table in his hall,\\r\\nand read a chapter, and then a long-winded prayer, after the\\r\\nPresbyterian way.\" Very displeased were the Chief Justice and the other\\r\\nJudge of Assize; and their dissatisfaction was not diminished on the\\r\\nfollowing day when on entering Exeter a rumor met them, that \"the judges\\r\\nhad been at a conventicle, and the grand jury intended to present them\\r\\nand all their retinue for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot many years elapsed before this Darling of the West was replaced, by\\r\\nanother Chief Justice who asserted the power of constituted authorities\\r\\nwith an energy that roused more fear than gratitude in the breasts of\\r\\nlocal magistrates. That grim, ghastly, hideous progress, which Jeffreys\\r\\nmade in the plenitude of civil and military power through the Western\\r\\nCounties, was not without its comic interludes; and of its less\\r\\nrepulsive scenes none was more laughable than that which occurred in\\r\\nBristol Courthouse when the terrible Chief Justice upbraided the Bristol\\r\\nmagistrates for taking part in a slave-trade of the most odious sort.\\r\\nThe mode in which the authorities of the western port carried on their\\r\\niniquitous traffic deserves commemoration, for no student can understand\\r\\nthe history of any period until he has acquainted himself with its\\r\\nprevailing morality. At a time when by the wealth of her merchants and\\r\\nthe political influence of her inhabitants Bristol was the second city\\r\\nof England, her mayor and aldermen used daily to sit in judgment on\\r\\nyoung men and growing boys, who were brought before them and charged\\r\\nwith trivial offences. Some of the prisoners had actually broken the\\r\\nlaw: but in a large proportion of the cases the accusations were totally\\r\\nfictitious--the arrests having been made in accordance with the\\r\\ndirections of the magistrates, on charges which the magistrates\\r\\nthemselves knew to be utterly without foundation. Every morning the\\r\\nBristol tolsey or court-house saw a crowd of those wretched\\r\\ncaptives--clerks out of employment, unruly apprentices, street boys\\r\\nwithout parents, and occasionally children of honest birth, ay, of\\r\\npatrician lineage, whose prompt removal from their native land was\\r\\ndesired by brutal fathers or vindictive guardians; and every morning a\\r\\nmockery of judicial investigation was perpetrated in the name of\\r\\njustice. Standing in a crowd the prisoners were informed of the offences\\r\\ncharged against them; huddled together in the dock, like cattle in a\\r\\npen, they caught stray sentences from the lips of the perjured rascals\\r\\nwho had seized them in the public ways; and whilst they thus in a frenzy\\r\\nof surprise and fear listened to the statements of counsel for the\\r\\nprosecution, and to the fabrications of lying witnesses, agents of the\\r\\ncourt whispered to them that if they wished to save their lives they\\r\\nmust instantly confess their guilt, and implore the justices to\\r\\ntransport them to the plantations. Ignorant, alarmed, and powerless, the\\r\\nmiserable victims invariably acted on this perfidious counsel; and\\r\\nforthwith the magistrates ordered their shipment to the West Indies,\\r\\nwhere they were sold as slaves--the money paid for them by West India\\r\\nplanters in due course finding its way into the pockets of the Bristol\\r\\njustices. It is asserted that the wealthier aldermen, through caution,\\r\\nor those few grains of conscience which are often found in the breasts\\r\\nof consummate rogues, forbore to share in the gains of this abominable\\r\\ntraffic; but it cannot be gainsaid that the least guilty magistrates\\r\\nwinked at the atrocious conduct of their brother-justices.\\r\\n\\r\\nVowing vengeance on the Bristol kidnappers Jeffreys entered their\\r\\ncourt-house, and opened proceedings by crying aloud that \"he had brought\\r\\na broom to sweep them with.\" The Mayor of Bristol was in those days no\\r\\ncommon mayor; in Assize Commissions his name was placed before the\\r\\nnames of Judges of Assize; and even beyond the limits of his\\r\\njurisdiction he was a man of mark and influence. Great therefore was\\r\\nthis dignitary\\'s astonishment when Jeffreys ordered him--clothed as he\\r\\nwas in official scarlet and furs--to stand in the dock. For a few\\r\\nseconds the local potentate demurred; but when the Chief Justice poured\\r\\nupon him a cataract of blasphemy, and vowed to hang him instantly over\\r\\nthe entrance to the tolsey unless he complied immediately, the\\r\\nhumiliated chief magistrate of the ancient borough took his place at the\\r\\nfelon\\'s bar, and received such a rating as no thief, murderer or rebel\\r\\nhad ever heard from George Jeffrey\\'s abusive mouth. Unfortunately the\\r\\naffair ended with the storm. Until the arrival of William of Orange the\\r\\nguilty magistrates were kept in fear of criminal prosecution; but the\\r\\nmatter was hushed up and covered with amnesty by the new government; so\\r\\nthat \"the fright only, which was no small one, was all the punishment\\r\\nwhich these judicial kidnappers underwent; and the gains,\" says Roger\\r\\nNorth, \"acquired by so wicked a trade, rested peacefully in their\\r\\npockets.\" It should be remembered that the kidnapping justices whom the\\r\\nodious Jeffreys so indignantly denounced were tolerated and courted by\\r\\ntheir respectable and prosperous neighbors; and some of the worst\\r\\ncharges, by which the judge\\'s fame has been rendered odious to\\r\\nposterity, depend upon the evidence of men who, if they were not\\r\\nkidnappers themselves, saw nothing peculiarly atrocious in the conduct\\r\\nof magistrates who systematically sold their fellow-countrymen into a\\r\\nmost barbarous slavery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst old circuit stories of questionable truthfulness there is a\\r\\nsingular anecdote recorded by the biographers of Chief Justice Hale,\\r\\nwho, whilst riding the Western Circuit, tried a half-starved lad on a\\r\\ncharges of burglary. The prisoner had been shipwrecked upon the Cornish\\r\\ncoast, and on his way through an inhospitable district had endured the\\r\\npangs of extreme hunger. In his distress, the famished wanderer broke\\r\\nthe window of a baker\\'s shop and stole a loaf of bread. Under the\\r\\ncircumstances, Hale directed the jury to acquit the prisoner: but, less\\r\\nmerciful than the judge, the gentlemen of the box returned a verdict of\\r\\n\\'Guilty\\'--a verdict which the Chief Justice stoutly refused to act upon.\\r\\nAfter much resistance, the jurymen were starved into submission; and the\\r\\nyouth was set at liberty. Several years elapsed; and Chief Justice Hale\\r\\nwas riding the Northern Circuit, when he was received with such costly\\r\\nand excessive pomp by the sheriff of a northern county, that he\\r\\nexpostulated with his entertainer on the lavish profuseness of his\\r\\nconduct. \"My lord,\" answered the sheriff, with emotion, \"don\\'t blame me\\r\\nfor showing my gratitude to the judge who saved my life when I was an\\r\\noutcast. Had it not been for you, I should have been hanged in Cornwall\\r\\nfor stealing a loaf, instead of living to be the richest landowner of my\\r\\nnative county.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA sketch of circuit-life in the middle of the last century may be found\\r\\nin \\'A Northern Circuit, Described in a Letter to a Friend: a Poetical\\r\\nEssay. By a Gentleman of the Middle Temple. 1751.\\'--a piece of doggrel\\r\\nthat will meet with greater mercy from the antiquary than the poetical\\r\\ncritic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn seeking to avoid the customary exactions of their office, the\\r\\nsheriffs of the present generation were only following in the steps of\\r\\nsheriffs who, more than a century past, exerted themselves to reduce the\\r\\nexpenses of shrievalties, and whose economical reforms were defended by\\r\\nreference to the conduct of sheriffs under the last of the Tudors.--In\\r\\nthe days of Elizabeth, the sheriffs demanded and obtained relief from an\\r\\nobligation to supply judges on circuit, with food and lodging; under\\r\\nVictoria they have recently exclaimed against the custom which required\\r\\nthem to furnish guards of javelin-bearers for the protection of Her\\r\\nMajesty\\'s representatives; when George II. was king, they grumbled\\r\\nagainst lighter burdens--for instance, the cost of white kid-gloves and\\r\\npayments to bell-ringers. The sheriff is still required by custom to\\r\\npresent the judges with white gloves whenever an assize has been held\\r\\nwithout a single capital conviction; but in past times, on every\\r\\n_maiden_ assize, he was expected to give gloves not only to the judges,\\r\\nbut to the entire body of circuiteers--barristers as well as officers of\\r\\ncourt.[34] Wishing to keep his official expenditure down to the lowest\\r\\npossible sum, a certain sheriff for Cumberland--called in \\'A Northern\\r\\nCircuit,\\' Sir Frigid Gripus Knapper--directed his under-sheriff not to\\r\\ngive white gloves on the occasion of a maiden assize at Carlisle, and\\r\\nalso through the mouth of his subordinate, declined to pay the officers\\r\\nof the circuit certain customary fees. To put the innovator to shame,\\r\\nSir William Gascoigne, the judge before whom the case was laid, observed\\r\\nin open court, \"Though I can compel an immediate payment, it being a\\r\\ndemand of right, and not a mere gift, yet I will set him an example by\\r\\ngifts which I might refuse, but will not, because they are customary,\"\\r\\nand forthwith addressing the steward, added--\"Call the sheriff\\'s\\r\\ncoachman, his pages, and musicians, singing-boys, and vergers, and give\\r\\nthem the accustomed gifts as soon as the sheriff comes.\" From this\\r\\ndirection, readers may see that under the old system of presents a judge\\r\\nwas compelled to give away with his left hand much of that which he\\r\\naccepted with his right. It appears that Sir William Gascoigne\\'s conduct\\r\\nhad the desired effect; for as soon as the sheriff made his appearance,\\r\\nhe repudiated the parsimonious conduct of the under-sheriff--though it\\r\\nis not credible that the subordinate acted without the direction or\\r\\nconcurrence of his superior. \"I think it,\" observed the sheriff, in\\r\\nreference to the sum of the customary payments, \"as much for the honor\\r\\nof my office, and the country in general, as it is justice to those to\\r\\nwhom it is payable; and if any sheriff has been of a different opinion\\r\\nit shall never bias me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the days when Alexander Wedderburn, in his new silk gown, to the\\r\\nscandal of all sticklers for professional etiquette, made a daring but\\r\\nfutile attempt to seize the lead of the circuit which seventeen years\\r\\nlater he rode as judge, \\'The Northern\\' had maintained the _prestige_ of\\r\\nbeing the most important of the English circuits. Its palmiest and most\\r\\nfamous days belong to the times of Norton and Wallace, Jack Lee and John\\r\\nScott, Edward Law and Robert Graham; but still amongst the wise white\\r\\nheads of the upper house may be seen at times the mobile features of an\\r\\naged peer who, as Mr. Henry Brougham, surpassed in eloquence and\\r\\nintellectual brilliance the brightest and most celebrated of his\\r\\nprecursors on the great northern round. But of all the great men whose\\r\\nnames illustrate the annals of the circuit, Lord Eldon is the person\\r\\nmost frequently remembered in connexion with the jovial ways of\\r\\ncircuiteers in the old time. In his later years the port-loving earl\\r\\ndelighted to recall the times when as Attorney General of the Circuit\\r\\nGrand Court he used to prosecute offenders \\'against the peace of our\\r\\nLord the Junior,\\' devise practical jokes for the diversion of the bar,\\r\\nand over bowls of punch at York, Lancaster, or Kirkby Lonsdale, argue\\r\\nperplexing questions about the morals of advocacy. Just as John\\r\\nCampbell, thirty years later, used to recount with glee how in the mock\\r\\ncourts of the Oxford Circuit he used to officiate as crier, \"holding a\\r\\nfire-shovel in his hand as the emblem of his office;\" so did old Lord\\r\\nEldon warm with mirth over recollections of his circuit revelries and\\r\\nescapades. Many of his stories were apocryphal, some of them\\r\\nunquestionably spurious; but the least truthful of them contained an\\r\\nelement of pleasant reality. Of course Jemmy Boswell, a decent lawyer,\\r\\nthough better biographer, was neither duped by the sham brief, nor\\r\\ninduced to apply in court for the writ of \\'quare adhaesit pavimento;\\'\\r\\nbut it is quite credible that on the morning after his removal in a\\r\\ncondition of vinous prostration from the Lancaster flagstones, his\\r\\njocose friends concocted the brief, sent it to him with a bad guinea,\\r\\nand proclaimed the success of their device. When the chimney-sweeper\\'s\\r\\nboy met his death by falling from a high gallery to the floor of the\\r\\ncourt-house at the York Assizes, whilst Sir Thomas Davenport was\\r\\nspeaking, it was John Scott who--arguing that the orator\\'s dullness had\\r\\nsent the boy to sleep, and so caused his fatal fall--prosecuted Sir\\r\\nThomas for murder in the High Court, alleging in the indictment that the\\r\\ndeath was produced by a \"certain blunt instrument of _no value_, called\\r\\na _long speech_.\" The records of the Northern Circuit abound with\\r\\ntestimony to the hearty zeal with which the future Chancellor took part\\r\\nin the proceedings of the Grand Court--paying fines and imposing them\\r\\nwith equal readiness, now upholding with mock gravity the high and\\r\\nmajestic character of the presiding judge, and at another time\\r\\ninveighing against the levity and indecorum of a learned brother who had\\r\\nmaintained in conversation that \"no man would be such a----fool as to go\\r\\nto a lawyer for advice who knew how to get on without it.\" The monstrous\\r\\noffender against religion and propriety who gave utterance to this\\r\\nexecrable sentiment was Pepper Arden (subsequently Master of the Rolls\\r\\nand Lord Alvanley), and his punishment is thus recorded in the archives\\r\\nof the circuit:--\"In this he was considered as doubly culpable, in the\\r\\nfirst place as having offended, against the laws of Almighty God by his\\r\\nprofane cursing; for which, however, he made a very sufficient atonement\\r\\nby paying a bottle of claret; and secondly, as having made use of an\\r\\nexpression which, if it should become a prevailing opinion, might have\\r\\nthe most alarming consequences to the profession, and was therefore\\r\\ndeservedly considered in a far more hideous light. For the last offence\\r\\nhe was fin\\'d 3 bottles. Pd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most ridiculous circumstances over which the Northern Circuit\\r\\nmen of the last generation delighted to laugh occurred at Newcastle,\\r\\nwhen Baron Graham--the poor lawyer, but a singularly amiable and placid\\r\\nman, of whom Jeckyll observed, \"no one but his sempstress could ruffle\\r\\nhim\"--rode the circuit, and was immortalized as \\'My Lord \\'Size,\\' in Mr.\\r\\nJohn Shield\\'s capital song--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"The jailor, for trial had brought up a thief,\\r\\n     Whose looks seemed a passport for Botany Bay;\\r\\n   The lawyers, some with and some wanting a brief,\\r\\n     Around the green table were seated so gay;\\r\\n   Grave jurors and witnesses waiting a call;\\r\\n     Attorneys and clients, more angry than wise;\\r\\n   With strangers and town-people, throng\\'d the Guildhall,\\r\\n     All watching and gaping to see my Lord \\'Size.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Oft stretch\\'d were their necks, oft erected their ears,\\r\\n     Still fancying they heard of the trumpets the sound,\\r\\n   When tidings arriv\\'d, which dissolv\\'d them in tears,\\r\\n     That my lord at the dead-house was then lying drown\\'d.\\r\\n   Straight left _tête-a-tête_ were the jailor and thief;\\r\\n     The horror-struck crowd to the dead-house quick hies;\\r\\n   Ev\\'n the lawyers, forgetful of fee and of brief,\\r\\n     Set off helter-skelter to view my Lord \\'Size.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"And now the Sandhill with the sad tidings rings,\\r\\n     And the tubs of the taties are left to take care;\\r\\n   Fishwomen desert their crabs, lobsters, and lings,\\r\\n     And each to the dead-house now runs like a hare;\\r\\n   The glassmen, some naked, some clad, heard the news,\\r\\n     And off they ran, smoking like hot mutton pies;\\r\\n   Whilst Castle Garth tailors, like wild kangaroos,\\r\\n     Came tail-on-end jumping to see my Lord \\'Size.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"The dead-house they reach\\'d, where his lordship they found,\\r\\n     Pale, stretch\\'d on a plank, like themselves out of breath,\\r\\n   The coroner and jury were seated around,\\r\\n     Most gravely enquiring the cause of his death.\\r\\n   No haste did they seem in, their task to complete,\\r\\n     Aware that from hurry mistakes often rise;\\r\\n   Or wishful, perhaps, of prolonging the treat\\r\\n     Of thus sitting in judgment upon my Lord \\'Size.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Now the Mansion House butler, thus gravely deposed:--\\r\\n     \\'My lord on the terrace seem\\'d studying his charge\\r\\n   And when (as I thought) he had got it compos\\'d,\\r\\n     He went down the stairs and examined the barge;\\r\\n   First the stem he surveyed, then inspected the stern,\\r\\n     Then handled the tiller, and looked mighty wise;\\r\\n   But he made a false step when about to return,\\r\\n     And souse in the river straight tumbled Lord \\'Size.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"\\'Now his narrative ended, the butler retir\\'d,\\r\\n     Whilst Betty Watt, muttering half drunk through her teeth,\\r\\n   Declar\\'d \\'in her breast great consarn it inspir\\'d,\\r\\n     That my lord should sae cullishly come by his death;\\'\\r\\n   Next a keelman was called on, Bold Airchy by name,\\r\\n     Who the book as he kissed showed the whites of his eyes,\\r\\n   Then he cut an odd caper attention to claim,\\r\\n     And this evidence gave them respecting Lord \\'Size;--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Aw was settin\\' the keel, wi\\' Dick Slavers an\\' Matt,\\r\\n     An\\' the Mansion House stairs we were just alongside,\\r\\n   When we a\\' three see\\'d somethin\\', but didn\\'t ken what,\\r\\n     That was splashin\\' and labberin\\', aboot i\\' the tide.\\r\\n   \\'It\\'s a fluiker,\\' ki Dick; \\'No,\\' ki Matt, \\'its owre big,\\r\\n     It luik\\'d mair like a skyet when aw furst seed it rise;\\'\\r\\n   Kiv aw--for aw\\'d getten a gliff o\\' the wig--\\r\\n     \\'Ods marcy!

It is\\r\\non record that whilst he and Mr. Holroyde were posting the Northern\\r\\nround, they were accosted on a lonely heath by a well-mounted horseman,\\r\\nwho reining in his steed asked the barrister \"What o\\'clock it was?\"\\r\\nFavorably impressed by the stranger\\'s appearance and tone of voice, Wood\\r\\npulled out his valuable gold repeater, when the highwayman presenting a\\r\\npistol, and putting it on the cock, said coolly, \"_As you have_ a watch,\\r\\nbe kind enough to give it me, so that I may not have occasion to trouble\\r\\nyou again about the time.\" To demur was impossible; the lawyer,\\r\\ntherefore, who had met his disaster by _going to the country_, meekly\\r\\nsubmitted to circumstances and surrendered the watch. For the loss of an\\r\\nexcellent gold repeater he cared little, but he winced under the banter\\r\\nof his professional brethren, who long after the occurrence used to\\r\\nsmile with malicious significance as they accosted him with--\"What\\'s the\\r\\ntime, Wood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother of the memorable Northern circuiteers was John Hullock, who,\\r\\nlike George Wood, became a baron of the Exchequer, and of whom the\\r\\nfollowing story is told on good authority. In an important cause tried\\r\\nupon the Northern Circuit, he was instructed by the attorney who\\r\\nretained him as leader on one side not to produce a certain deed unless\\r\\ncircumstances made him think that without its production his client\\r\\nwould lose the suit. On perusing the deed entrusted to him with this\\r\\nremarkable injunction, Hullock saw that it established his client\\'s\\r\\ncase, and wishing to dispatch the business with all possible\\r\\npromptitude, he produced the parchment before its exhibition was\\r\\ndemanded by necessity. Examination instantly detected the spurious\\r\\ncharacter of the deed, which had been fabricated by the attorney. Of\\r\\ncourse the presiding judge (Sir John Bayley) ordered the deed to be\\r\\nimpounded; but before the order was carried out, Mr. Hullock obtained\\r\\npermission to inspect it again. Restored to his hands, the deed was\\r\\nforthwith replaced in his bag. \"You must surrender that deed instantly,\"\\r\\nexclaimed the judge, seeing Hullock\\'s intention to keep it. \"My lord,\"\\r\\nreturned the barrister, warmly, \"no power on earth shall induce me to\\r\\nsurrender it. I have incautiously put the life of a fellow-creature in\\r\\nperil; and though I acted to the best of my discretion, I should never\\r\\nbe happy again were a fatal result to ensue.\" At a loss to decide on the\\r\\nproper course of action, Mr. Justice Bayley retired from court to\\r\\nconsult with his learned brother. On his lordship\\'s reappearance in\\r\\ncourt, Mr. Hullock--who had also left the court for a brief period--told\\r\\nhim that during his absence the forged deed had been destroyed. The\\r\\nattorney escaped; the barrister became a judge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[33] Lord Eldon, when he was handsome Jack Scott of the Northern\\r\\nCircuit, was about to make a short cut over the sands from Ulverstone to\\r\\nLancaster at the of the tide, when he was restrained from acting on his\\r\\nrash resolve by the representations of an hotel keeper. \"Danger,\\r\\ndanger,\" asked Scott, impatiently--\"have you ever _lost_ anybody there?\"\\r\\nMine host answered slowly, \"Nae, sir, nae body has been _lost_ on the\\r\\nsands, _the puir bodies have been found at low water_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[34] With regard to the customary gifts of white gloves Mr. Foss\\r\\nsays:--\"Gloves were presented to the judges on some occasions: viz.,\\r\\nwhen a man, convicted for murder, or manslaughter, came and pleaded the\\r\\nking\\'s pardon; and, till the Act of 4 & 5 William and Mary c. 18, which\\r\\nrendered personal appearance unnecessary, an outlawry could not be\\r\\nreversed, unless the defendant came into court, and with a present of\\r\\ngloves to the judges implored their favor to reverse it. The custom of\\r\\ngiving the judge a pair of white gloves upon a maiden assize has\\r\\ncontinued till the present time.\" An interesting chapter might be\\r\\nwritten on the ancient ceremonies and usages obsolete and extant, of our\\r\\ncourts of law. Here are a few of the practices which such a chapter\\r\\nwould properly notice:--The custom, still maintained, which forbids the\\r\\nLord Chancellor to utter any word or make any sign, when on Lord Mayor\\'s\\r\\nDay the Lord Mayor of London enters the Court of Chancery, and by the\\r\\nmouth of the Recorder prays his lordship to honor the Guildhall banquet\\r\\nwith his presence; the custom--extant so late as Lord Brougham\\'s\\r\\nChancellorship--which required the Holder of the Seals, at the\\r\\ninstallation of a new Master of Chancery, to install the new master by\\r\\nplacing a cap or hat on his head; the custom which in Charles II.\\'s\\r\\ntime, on motion days at the Chancellor\\'s, compelled all barristers\\r\\nmaking motions to contribute to his lordship\\'s \\'Poor\\'s Box\\'--barristers\\r\\nwithin the bar paying two shillings, and outer barristers one\\r\\nshilling--the contents of which box were periodically given to\\r\\nmagistrates, for distribution amongst the deserving poor of London; the\\r\\ncustom which required a newly-created judge to present his colleagues\\r\\nwith biscuits and wine; the barbarous custom which compelled prisoners\\r\\nto plead their defence, standing in fetters, a custom enforced by Chief\\r\\nJustice Pratt at the trial of the Jacobite against Christopher Layer,\\r\\nalthough at the of trial of Cranburne for complicity in the\\r\\n\\'Assassination Plot,\\' Holt had enunciated the merciful maxim, \"When the\\r\\nprisoners are tried they should stand at ease;\" the custom which--in\\r\\ndays when forty persons died of gaol fever caught at the memorable Black\\r\\nSessions (May, 1759) at the Old Bailey, when Captain Clark was tried for\\r\\nkilling Captain Innes in a duel--strewed rue, fennel, and other herbs on\\r\\nthe ledge of the dock, in the faith that the odor of the herbage would\\r\\nact as a barrier to the poisonous exhalations from prisoners sick of\\r\\ngaol distemper, and would protect the assembly in the body of the court\\r\\nfrom the contagion of the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAWYERS AND SAINTS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding the close connexion which in old times existed between\\r\\nthe Church and the Law, popular sentiment holds to the opinion that the\\r\\nways of lawyers are far removed from the ways of holiness, and that the\\r\\ndifficulties encountered by wealthy travellers on the road to heaven are\\r\\nfar greater with rich lawyers than with any other class of rich men. An\\r\\nold proverb teaches that wearers of the long robe never reach paradise\\r\\n_per saltum_, but \\'by slow degrees;\\' and an irreverent ballad supports\\r\\nthe vulgar belief that the only attorney to be found on the celestial\\r\\nrolls gained admittance to the blissful abode more by artifice than\\r\\ndesert. The ribald broadside runs in the following style:---\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Professions will abuse each other;\\r\\n   The priests won\\'t call the lawyer brother;\\r\\n   While _Salkeld_ still beknaves the parson,\\r\\n   And says he cants to keep the farce on.\\r\\n   Yet will I readily suppose\\r\\n   They are not truly bitter foes,\\r\\n   But only have their pleasant jokes,\\r\\n   And banter, just like other folks.\\r\\n   And thus, for so they quiz the law,\\r\\n   Once on a time th\\' Attorney Flaw,\\r\\n   A man to tell you, as the fact is,\\r\\n   Of vast chicane, of course of practice;\\r\\n   (But what profession can we trace\\r\\n   Where none will not the corps disgrace?\\r\\n   Seduced, perhaps, by roguish client,\\r\\n   Who tempt him to become more pliant),\\r\\n   A notice had to quit the world,\\r\\n   And from his desk at once was hurled.\\r\\n   Observe, I pray, the plain narration:\\r\\n   \\'Twas in a hot and long vacation,\\r\\n   When time he had but no assistance.\\r\\n   Tho\\' great from courts of law the distance,\\r\\n   To reach the court of truth and justice\\r\\n   (Where I confess my only trust is);\\r\\n   Though here below the special pleader\\r\\n   Shows talents worthy of a leader,\\r\\n   Yet his own fame he must support,\\r\\n   Be sometimes witty with the court\\r\\n   Or word the passion of a jury\\r\\n   By tender strains, or full of fury;\\r\\n   Misleads them all, tho\\' twelve apostles,\\r\\n   While with the new law the judge he jostles,\\r\\n   And makes them all give up their powers\\r\\n   To speeches of at least three hours--\\r\\n   But we have left our little man,\\r\\n   And wandered from our purpos\\'d plan:\\r\\n   \\'Tis said (without ill-natured leaven)\\r\\n   \"If ever lawyers get to heaven,\\r\\n   It surely is by slow degrees\"\\r\\n   (Perhaps \\'tis slow they take their fees).\\r\\n   The case, then, now I fairly state:\\r\\n   Flaw reached at last to heaven\\'s high gate;\\r\\n   Quite short he rapped, none did it neater;\\r\\n   The gate was opened by St. Peter,\\r\\n   Who looked astonished when he saw,\\r\\n   All black, the little man of law;\\r\\n   But charity was Peter\\'s guide.\\r\\n   For having once himself denied\\r\\n   His master, he would not o\\'erpass\\r\\n   The penitent of any class;\\r\\n   Yet never having heard there entered\\r\\n   A lawyer, nay, nor ever ventured\\r\\n   Within the realms of peace and love,\\r\\n   He told him mildly to remove,\\r\\n   And would have closed the gate of day,\\r\\n   Had not old Flaw, in suppliant way,\\r\\n   Demurring to so hard a fate,\\r\\n   Begg\\'d but a look, tho\\' through the gate.\\r\\n   St. Peter, rather off his guard,\\r\\n   Unwilling to be thought too hard,\\r\\n   Opens the gate to let him peep in.\\r\\n   What did the lawyer? Did he creep in?\\r\\n   Or dash at once to take possession?\\r\\n   Oh no, he knew his own profession:\\r\\n   He took his hat off with respect,\\r\\n   And would no gentle means neglect;\\r\\n   But finding it was all in vain\\r\\n   For him admittance to obtain,\\r\\n   Thought it were best, let come what will,\\r\\n   To gain an entry by his skill.\\r\\n   So while St. Peter stood aside,\\r\\n   To let the door be opened wide,\\r\\n   He skimmed his hat with all his strength\\r\\n   Within the gate to no small length.\\r\\n   St. Peter stared; the lawyer asked him\\r\\n   \"Only to fetch his hat,\" and passed him;\\r\\n   But when he reached the jack he\\'d thrown,\\r\\n   Oh, then was all the lawyer shown;\\r\\n   He clapt it on, and arms akembo\\r\\n   (As if he had been the gallant Bembo),\\r\\n   Cry\\'d out--\\'What think you of my plan?\\r\\n   Eject me, Peter, if you can.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe celestial courts having devised no process of ejectment that could\\r\\nbe employed in this unlooked-for emergency, St. Peter hastily withdrew\\r\\nto take counsel\\'s opinion; and during his absence Mr. Flaw firmly\\r\\nestablished himself in the realms of bliss, where he remains to this day\\r\\nthe black sheep of the saintly family.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though a flippant humorist in these later times could deride the\\r\\nlawyer as a character who had better not force his way into heaven,\\r\\nsince he would not find a single personal acquaintance amongst its\\r\\ninhabitants, in more remote days lawyers achieved the honors of\\r\\ncanonization, and our forefathers sought their saintly intercession with\\r\\ndevout fervor. Our calendars still regard the 15th of July as a sacred\\r\\nday, in memory of the holy Swithin, who was tutor to King Ethelwulf and\\r\\nKing Alfred, and Chancellor of England, and who certainly deserved his\\r\\nelevation to the fellowship of saints, even had his title to the honor\\r\\nrested solely on a remarkable act which he performed in the exercise of\\r\\nhis judicial functions. A familiar set of nursery rhymes sets forth the\\r\\nutter inability of all the King\\'s horses and men to reform the shattered\\r\\nHumpty-Dumpty, when his rotund highness had fallen from a wall; but when\\r\\na wretched market-woman, whose entire basketful of new-laid eggs had\\r\\nbeen wilfully smashed by an enemy, sought in her trouble the aid of\\r\\nChancery, the holy Chancellor Swithin miraculously restored each broken\\r\\nshell to perfect shape, each yolk to soundness. Saith William of\\r\\nMalmesbury, recounting this marvellous achievement--\"statimque porrecto\\r\\ncrucis signo, fracturam omnium ovorum consolidat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Chancellor Swithin before him, and like Chancellor Wolsey in a\\r\\nlater time, Chancellor Becket was a royal tutor;[35] and like Swithin,\\r\\nwho still remains the pluvious saint of humid England, and unlike\\r\\nWolsey, who just missed the glory of canonization, Becket became a\\r\\nwidely venerated saint. But less kind to St. Thomas of Canterbury than\\r\\nto St. Swithin, the Reformation degraded Becket from the saintly rank by\\r\\nthe decision which terminated the ridiculous legal proceedings\\r\\ninstituted by Henry VIII. against the holy reputation of St. Thomas.\\r\\nAfter the saint\\'s counsel had replied to the Attorney-General, who, of\\r\\ncourse, conducted the cause for the crown, the court declared that\\r\\n\"Thomas, sometime Archbishop of Canterbury, had been guilty of\\r\\ncontumacy, treason and rebellion; that his bones should be publicly\\r\\nburnt, to admonish the living of their duty by the punishment of the\\r\\ndead; and that the offerings made at his shrine should be forfeited to\\r\\nthe crown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the conclusion of the suit for the saint\\'s degradation--a suit\\r\\nwhich was an extravagant parody of the process for establishing at Rome\\r\\na holy man\\'s title to the honors of canonization--proclamation was made\\r\\nthat \"forasmuch as it now clearly appeared that Thomas Becket had been\\r\\nkilled in a riot excited by his own obstinacy and intemperate language,\\r\\nand had been afterwards canonized by the Bishop of Rome as the champion\\r\\nof his usurped authority, the king\\'s majesty thought it expedient to\\r\\ndeclare to his loving subjects that he was no saint, but rather a rebel\\r\\nand traitor to his prince, and therefore strictly charged and commanded\\r\\nthat he should not be esteemed or called a saint; that all images and\\r\\npictures of him should be destroyed, the festivals in his honor be\\r\\nabolished, and his name and remembrance be erased out of all books,\\r\\nunder pain of his majesty\\'s indignation and imprisonment at his grace\\'s\\r\\npleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut neither St. Swithin nor St. Thomas of Canterbury, lawyers though\\r\\nthey were, deigned to take the legal profession under especial\\r\\nprotection, and to mediate with particular officiousness between the\\r\\nlong robe and St. Peter. The peculiar saint of the profession was St.\\r\\nEvona, concerning whom Carr, in his \\'Remarks of the Government of the\\r\\nSeverall Parts of Germanie, Denmark, &c.,\\' has the following passage:\\r\\nAnd now because I am speaking of Petty-foggers, give me leave to tell\\r\\nyou a story I mett with when I lived in Rome. Goeing with a Romane to\\r\\nsee some antiquityes, he showed me a chapell dedicated to St. Evona, a\\r\\nlawyer of Brittanie, who, he said, came to Rome to entreat the Pope to\\r\\ngive the lawyers of Brittanie a patron, to which the Pope replied, that\\r\\nhe knew of no saint but what was disposed to other professions. At which\\r\\nEvona was very sad, and earnestly begd of the Pope to think of one for\\r\\nhim. At last the Pope proposed to St. Evona that he should go round the\\r\\nchurch of St. John de Latera blindfold, and after he had said so many\\r\\nAve Marias, that the first saint he laid hold of should be his patron,\\r\\nwhich the good old lawyer willingly undertook, and at the end of his Ave\\r\\nMaryes he stopt at St. Michael\\'s altar, where he layed hold of the\\r\\nDivell, under St. Michael\\'s feet, and cry\\'d out, this is our saint, let\\r\\nhim be our patron. So being unblindfolded, and seeing what a patron he\\r\\nhad chosen, he went to his lodgings so dejected, that a few moneths\\r\\nafter he died, and coming to heaven\\'s gates knockt hard. Whereupon St.\\r\\nPeter asked who it was that knockt so bouldly. He replied that he was\\r\\nSt. Evona the advocate. Away, away, said St. Peter, here is but one\\r\\nadvocate in Heaven; here is no room for you lawyers. O but, said St.\\r\\nEvona, I am that honest lawyer who never tooke fees on both sides, or\\r\\npleaded in a bad cause, nor did I ever set my Naibours together by the\\r\\nears, or lived by the sins of the People. Well, then, said St. Peter,\\r\\ncome in. This newes coming down to Rome, a witty poet wrote on St.\\r\\nEvona\\'s tomb these words:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \\'St. Evona un Briton,\\r\\n   Advocat non Larron.\\r\\n             Hallelujah.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story put me in mind of Ben Jonson goeing throw a church in Surrey,\\r\\nseeing poore people weeping over a grave, asked one of the women why\\r\\nthey wept. Oh, said shee, we have lost our pretious lawyer, Justice\\r\\nRandall; he kept us all in peace, and always was so good as to keep us\\r\\nfrom goeing to law; the best man ever lived. Well, said Ben Jonson, I\\r\\nwill send you an epitaph to write upon his tomb, which was--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \\'God works wonders now and then,\\r\\n   Here lies a lawyer an honest man.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important vestige of the close relations which formerly existed\\r\\nbetween the Law and the Church is still found in the ecclesiastical\\r\\npatronage of the Lord Chancellor; and many are the good stories told of\\r\\ninterviews that took place between our more recent chancellors and\\r\\nclergymen suing for preferment. \"Who sent you, sir?\" Thurlow asked\\r\\nsavagely of a country curate, who had boldly forced his way into the\\r\\nChancellor\\'s library in Great Ormond Street, in the hope of winning the\\r\\npresentation to a vacant living. \"In whose _name_ do you come, that you\\r\\nventure to pester me about your private affairs? I say, sir--what great\\r\\nlords sent you to bother me in my house?\" \"My Lord,\" answered the\\r\\napplicant, with a happy combination of dignity and humor, \"no great man\\r\\nsupports my entreaty; but I may say with honesty, that I come to you in\\r\\nthe name of the Lord of Hosts.\" Pleased by the spirit and wit of the\\r\\nreply, Thurlow exclaimed, \"The Lord of Hosts! the Lord of Hosts! you are\\r\\nthe first parson that ever applied to me in that Lord\\'s name; and though\\r\\nhis title can\\'t be found in the Peerage, by ---- you shall have the\\r\\nliving.\" On another occasion the same Chancellor was less benign, but\\r\\nnot less just to a clerical applicant. Sustained by Queen Charlotte\\'s\\r\\npersonal favor and intercession with Thurlow, the clergyman in question\\r\\nfelt so sure of obtaining the valuable living which was the object of\\r\\nhis ambition, that he regarded his interview with the Chancellor as a\\r\\npurely formal affair. \"I have, sir,\" observed Lord Thurlow, \"received a\\r\\nletter from the curate of the parish to which it is my intention to\\r\\nprefer you, and on inquiry I find him to be a very worthy man. The\\r\\nfather of a large family, and a priest who has labored zealously in the\\r\\nparish for many years, he has written to me--not asking for the living,\\r\\nbut modestly entreating me to ask the new rector to retain him as\\r\\ncurate. Now, sir, you would oblige me by promising me to employ the poor\\r\\nman in that capacity.\" \"My lord,\" replied Queen Charlotte\\'s pastor, \"it\\r\\nwould give me great pleasure to oblige your lordship in this matter, but\\r\\nunfortunately I have arranged to take a personal friend for my curate.\"\\r\\nHis eyes flashing angrily, Thurlow answered, \"Sir, I cannot force you to\\r\\ntake this worthy man for your curate, but I can make him the rector; and\\r\\nby ---- he shall have the living, and be in a position to offer you the\\r\\ncuracy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Lord Loughborough a reliable biographer records a pleasant and\\r\\nsingular story. Having pronounced a decision in the House of Lords,\\r\\nwhich deprived an excellent clergyman of a considerable estate and\\r\\nreduced him to actual indigence, the Chancellor, before quitting the\\r\\nwoolsack, addressed the unfortunate suitor thus:--\"As a judge I have\\r\\ndecided against you, whose virtues are not unknown to me; and in\\r\\nacknowledgment of those virtues I beg you to accept from me a\\r\\npresentation to a living now vacant, and worth £600 per annum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital also are the best of many anecdotes concerning Eldon and his\\r\\necclesiastical patronage. Dating the letter from No. 2, Charlotte\\r\\nStreet, Pimlico, the Chancellor\\'s eldest son sent his father the\\r\\nfollowing anonymous epistle:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Hear, generous lawyer! hear my prayer,\\r\\n   Nor let my freedom make, you stare,\\r\\n             In hailing you Jack Scott!\\r\\n   Tho\\' now upon the woolsack placed,\\r\\n   With wealth, with power, with title graced,\\r\\n             _Once_ nearer was our lot.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Say by what name the hapless bard\\r\\n   May best attract your kind regard--\\r\\n             Plain Jack?--Sir John?--or Eldon?\\r\\n   Give from your ample store of giving,\\r\\n   A starving priest some little living--\\r\\n             The world will cry out \\'Well done.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"In vain, without a patron\\'s aid,\\r\\n   I\\'ve prayed and preached, and preached and prayed--\\r\\n             _Applauded_ but _ill-fed_.\\r\\n   Such vain _éclat_ let others share;\\r\\n   Alas, I cannot feed on air--\\r\\n             I ask not _praise_, but _bread_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSatisfactorily hoaxed by the rhymer, the Chancellor went to Pimlico in\\r\\nsearch of the clerical poetaster, and found him not.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrettier and less comic is the story of Miss Bridge\\'s morning call upon\\r\\nLord Eldon. The Chancellor was sitting in his study over a table of\\r\\npapers when a young and lovely girl--slightly rustic in her attire,\\r\\nslightly embarrassed by the novelty of her position, but thoroughly in\\r\\ncommand of her wits--entered the room, and walked up to the lawyer\\'s\\r\\nchair. \"My dear,\" said the Chancellor, rising and bowing with old-world\\r\\ncourtesy, \"who _are_ you?\" \"Lord Eldon,\" answered the blushing maiden,\\r\\n\"I am Bessie Bridge of Weobly, the daughter of the Vicar of Weobly, and\\r\\npapa has sent me to remind you of a promise which you made him when I\\r\\nwas a little baby, and you were a guest in his house on the occasion of\\r\\nyour first election as member of Parliament for Weobly.\" \"A promise, my\\r\\ndear young lady?\" interposed the Chancellor, trying to recall how he had\\r\\npledged himself. \"Yea, Lord Eldon, a promise. You were standing over my\\r\\ncradle when papa said to you, \\'Mr. Scott, promise me that if ever you\\r\\nare Lord Chancellor, when my little girl is a poor clergyman\\'s wife, you\\r\\nwill give her husband a living;\\' and you answered, \\'Mr. Bridge, my\\r\\npromise is not worth half-a-crown, but I give it to you, wishing it were\\r\\nworth more.\\'\" Enthusiastically the Chancellor exclaimed, \"You are quite\\r\\nright. I admit the obligation. I remember all about it;\" and, then,\\r\\nafter a pause, archly surveying the damsel, whose graces were the\\r\\nreverse of matronly, he added, \"But surely the time for keeping my\\r\\npromise has not yet arrived? You cannot be any one\\'s wife at present?\"\\r\\nFor a few seconds Bessie hesitated for an answer, and then, with a blush\\r\\nand a ripple of silver laughter she replied, \"No, but I do so wish to be\\r\\n_somebody\\'s_ wife. I am engaged to a young clergyman; and there\\'s a\\r\\nliving in Herefordshire near my old home that has recently fallen\\r\\nvacant, and if you\\'ll give it to Alfred, why then, Lord Eldon, we shall\\r\\nmarry before the end of the year.\" Is there need to say that the\\r\\nChancellor forthwith summoned his Secretary, that the secretary\\r\\nforthwith made out the presentation to Bessie\\'s lover, and that having\\r\\ngiven the Chancellor a kiss of gratitude, Bessie made good speed back to\\r\\nHerefordshire, hugging the precious document the whole way home?\\r\\n\\r\\nA bad but eager sportsman, Lord Eldon used to blaze away at his\\r\\npartridges and pheasants with such uniform want of success that Lord\\r\\nStowell had truth as well as humor on his side when he observed, \"My\\r\\nbrother has done much execution this shooting season; with his gun he\\r\\nhas _killed a great deal of time_.\" Having ineffectually discharged two\\r\\nbarrels at a covey of partridges, the Chancellor was slowly walking to\\r\\nthe gate of one of his Encome turnip-fields when a stranger of clerical\\r\\ngarb and aspect hailed him from a distance, asking, \"Where is Lord\\r\\nEldon?\" Not anxious to declare himself to the witness of his ludicrously\\r\\nbad shot, the Chancellor answered evasively, and with scant courtesy,\\r\\n\"Not far off.\" Displeased with the tone of this curt reply, the\\r\\nclergyman rejoined, \"I wish you\\'d use your tongue to better purpose than\\r\\nyou do your gun, and tell me civily where I can find the Chancellor.\"\\r\\n\"Well,\" responded the sportsman, when he had slowly approached his\\r\\nquestioner, \"here you see the Chancellor--I am Lord Eldon.\" It was an\\r\\nuntoward introduction to the Chancellor for the strange clergyman who\\r\\nhad traveled from the North of Lancashire to ask for the presentation to\\r\\na vacant living. Partly out of humorous compassion for the applicant who\\r\\nhad offered rudeness, if not insult to the person whom he was most\\r\\nanxious to propitiate; partly because on inquiry he ascertained the\\r\\nrespectability of the applicant; and partly because he wished to seal by\\r\\nkindness the lips of a man who could report on the authority of his own\\r\\neyes that the best lawyer was also the worst shot in all England, Eldon\\r\\ngave the petitioner the desired preferment. \"But now,\" the old\\r\\nChancellor used to add in conclusion, whenever he told the story, \"see\\r\\nthe ingratitude of mankind. It was not long before a large present of\\r\\ngame reached me, with a letter from my new-made rector, purporting that\\r\\nhe had sent it to me, because _from what he had seen of my shooting he_\\r\\nsupposed I must be badly off for game. Think of turning upon me in this\\r\\nway, and wounding me in my tenderest point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst Eldon\\'s humorous answers to applications for preferment should\\r\\nbe remembered his letter to Dr. Fisher of the Charterhouse: on one side\\r\\nof a sheet of paper, \"Dear Fisher, I cannot, to-day, give you the\\r\\npreferment for which you ask.--I remain your sincere friend,\\r\\nELDON.--_Turn over_;\" and on the other side, \"I gave it to you\\r\\nyesterday.\" This note reminds us of Erskine\\'s reply to Sir John\\r\\nSinclair\\'s solicitation for a subscription to the testimonial which Sir\\r\\nJohn invited the nation to present to himself. On the one side of a\\r\\nsheet of paper it ran, \"My dear Sir John, I am certain there are few in\\r\\nthis kingdom who set a higher value on your services than myself, and I\\r\\nhave the honor to subscribe,\" and on the other side it concluded,\\r\\n\"myself your obedient faithful servant, ERSKINE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[35] Swithin was tutor to Ethelwulf and Alfred. Becket was tutor to\\r\\nHenry II.\\'s eldest son. Wolsey--who took delight in discharging\\r\\nscholastic functions from the days when he birched schoolboys at\\r\\nMagdalen College, Oxford, till the time when in the plenitude of his\\r\\ngrandeur he framed regulations for Dean Colet\\'s school of St. Paul\\'s and\\r\\nwrote an introduction to a Latin Grammar for the use of children--acted\\r\\nas educational director to the Princess Mary, and superintended the\\r\\nstudies of Henry VIII.\\'s natural son, the Earl of Richmond. Amongst\\r\\npedagogue-chancellors, by license of fancy, may be included the Earl of\\r\\nClarendon, whose enemies used to charge him with \\'playing the\\r\\nschoolmaster to his king,\\' and in their desire to bring him into\\r\\ndisfavor at court used to announce his approach to Charles II. by\\r\\nsaying, \"Here comes your schoolmaster.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART IX.\\r\\n\\r\\nAT HOME: IN COURT: AND IN SOCIETY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLV.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAWYERS AT THEIR OWN TABLES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long list, indeed, might be made of abstemious lawyers; but their\\r\\ntemperance is almost invariably mentioned by biographers as matter for\\r\\nregret and apology, and is even made an occasion for reproach in cases\\r\\nwhere it has not been palliated by habits of munificent hospitality. In\\r\\nthe catalogue of Chancellor Warham\\'s virtues and laudable usages,\\r\\nErasmus takes care to mention that the primate was accustomed to\\r\\nentertain his friends, to the number of two hundred at a time: and when\\r\\nthe man of letters notices the archbishop\\'s moderation with respect to\\r\\nwines and dishes--a moderation that caused his grace to eschew suppers,\\r\\nand never to sit more than an hour at dinner--he does not omit to\\r\\nobserve that though the great man \"made it a rule to abstain entirely\\r\\nfrom supper, yet if his friends were assembled at that meal he would sit\\r\\ndown along with them and promote their conviviality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSplendid in all things, Wolsey astounded envious nobles by the\\r\\nmagnificence of his banquets, and the lavish expenses of his kitchens,\\r\\nwherein his master-cooks wore raiment of richest materials--the _chef_\\r\\nof his private kitchen daily arraying himself in a damask-satin or\\r\\nvelvet, and wearing on his neck a chain of gold. Of a far other kind\\r\\nwere the tastes of Wolsey\\'s successor, who, in the warmest sunshine of\\r\\nhis power, preferred a quiet dinner with Erasmus to the pompous display\\r\\nof state banquets, and who wore a gleeful light in his countenance when,\\r\\nafter his fall, he called his children and grandchildren about him, and\\r\\nsaid: \"I have been brought up at Oxford, at an Inn of Chancery, at\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn, and in the King\\'s Court--from the lowest degree to the\\r\\nhighest, and yet have I in yearly revenues at this present, little left\\r\\nme above a hundred pounds by the year; so that now, if we wish to live\\r\\ntogether, you must be content to be contributaries together. But my\\r\\ncounsel is that we fall not to the lowest fare first; we will not,\\r\\ntherefore, descend to Oxford fare, nor to the fare of New Inn, but we\\r\\nwill begin with Lincoln\\'s Inn diet, where many right worshipful men of\\r\\ngreat account and good years do live full well; which if we find\\r\\nourselves the first year not able to maintain, then will we in the next\\r\\nyear come down to Oxford fare, where many great, learned, and ancient\\r\\nfathers and doctors are continually conversant; which if our purses\\r\\nstretch not to maintain neither, then may we after, with bag and wallet,\\r\\ngo a-begging together, hoping that for pity some good folks will give us\\r\\ntheir charity and at every man\\'s door to sing a _Salve Regina_, whereby\\r\\nwe shall keep company and be merry together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents recalling the social life of England should bear in mind the\\r\\nhours kept by our ancestors in the fourteenth and two following\\r\\ncenturies. Under the Plantagenets noblemen used to sup at five P.M., and\\r\\ndine somewhere about the breakfast hour of Mayfair in a modern London\\r\\nseason. Gradually hours became later; but under the Tudors the ordinary\\r\\ndinner hour for gentlepeople was somewhere about eleven A.M., and their\\r\\nusual time for supping was between five P.M. and six P.M., tradesmen,\\r\\nmerchants and farmers dining and supping at later hours than their\\r\\nsocial superiors. \"With us,\" says Hall the chronicler, \"the nobility,\\r\\ngentry, and students, do ordinarily go to dinner at eleven before noon,\\r\\nand to supper at five, or between five and six, at afternoon. The\\r\\nmerchants dine and sup seldom before twelve at noon and six at night.\\r\\nThe husbandmen also dine at high noon as they call it, and sup at seven\\r\\nor eight; but out of term in our universities the scholars dine at ten.\"\\r\\nThus whilst the idlers of society made haste to eat and drink, the\\r\\nworkers postponed the pleasures of the table until they had made a good\\r\\nmorning\\'s work. In the days of morning dinners and afternoon suppers,\\r\\nthe law-courts used to be at the height of their daily business at an\\r\\nhour when Templars of the present generation have seldom risen from bed.\\r\\nChancellors were accustomed to commence their daily sittings in\\r\\nWestminster at seven A.M. in summer, and at eight A.M. in winter months.\\r\\nLord Keeper Williams, who endeavored to atone for want of law by\\r\\nextraordinarily assiduous attention to the duties of his office, used\\r\\nindeed to open his winter sittings by candlelight between six and seven\\r\\no\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany were the costly banquets of which successive Chancellors invited\\r\\nthe nobility, the judges, and the bar, to partake at old York House; but\\r\\nof all the holders of the Great Seal who exercised pompous hospitality\\r\\nin that picturesque palace, Francis Bacon was the most liberal,\\r\\ngracious, and delightful entertainer. Where is the student of English\\r\\nhistory who has not often endeavored to imagine the scene when Ben\\r\\nJonson sat amongst the honored guests of\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"England\\'s high Chancellor, the destin\\'d heir,\\r\\n   In his soft cradle, to his father\\'s chair,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nand little prescient of the coming storm, spoke of his host as one\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Whose even thread the Fates spin round and full,\\r\\n   Out of their choicest and their whitest wool.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven at the present day lawyers have reason to be grateful to Bacon for\\r\\nthe promptitude with which, on taking possession of the Marble Chair, he\\r\\nrevived the ancient usages of earlier holders of the seal, and set an\\r\\nexample of courteous hospitality to the bar, which no subsequent\\r\\nChancellor has been able to disregard without loss of respect and\\r\\n_prestige_. Though a short attack of gout qualified the new pleasure of\\r\\nhis elevation--an attack attributed by the sufferer to his removal \"from\\r\\na field air to a Thames air,\" _i.e._, from Gray\\'s Inn to the south side\\r\\nof the Strand--Lord Keeper Bacon lost no time in summoning the judges\\r\\nand most eminent barristers to his table; and though the gravity of his\\r\\nindisposition, or the dignity of his office, forbade him to join in the\\r\\nfeast, he sat and spoke pleasantly with them when the dishes had been\\r\\nremoved. \"Yesterday,\" he wrote to Buckingham, \"which was my weary day, I\\r\\nbid all the judges to dinner, which was not used to be, and entertained\\r\\nthem in a private withdrawing chamber with the learned counsel. When the\\r\\nfeast was past I came amongst them and sat me down at the end of the\\r\\ntable, and prayed them to think I was one of them, and but a foreman.\"\\r\\nNor let us, whilst recalling Bacon\\'s bounteous hospitalities, fail in\\r\\njustice to his great rival, Sir Edward Coke---who, though he usually\\r\\nheld himself aloof from frivolous amusements, and cared but little for\\r\\nexpensive repasts, would with a liberal hand place lordly dishes before\\r\\nlordly guests; and of whom it is recorded in the \\'Apophthegmes,\\' that\\r\\nwhen any great visitor dropped in upon him for pot-luck without notice\\r\\nhe was wont to say, \"Sir, since you sent me no notice of your coming,\\r\\nyou must dine with me; but if I had known of it in due time I would have\\r\\ndined with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom such great men as Lord Nottingham and Lord Guildford, who\\r\\nsuccessively kept high state in Queen Street, Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields, to\\r\\nfat _puisnes_ occupying snug houses in close proximity to the Inns of\\r\\nCourt, and lower downwards to leaders of the bar and juniors sleeping as\\r\\nwell as working in chambers, the Restoration lawyers were conspicuous\\r\\npromoters of the hilarity which was one of the most prominent and least\\r\\noffensive characteristics of Charles II.\\'s London. Lord Nottingham\\'s\\r\\nsumptuous hospitalities were the more creditable, because he voluntarily\\r\\nrelinquished his claim to £4000 per annum, which the royal bounty had\\r\\nassigned him as a fund to be expended in official entertainments.\\r\\nSimilar praise cannot be awarded to Lord Guildford; but justice compels\\r\\nthe admission that, notwithstanding his love of money, he maintained the\\r\\n_prestige_ of his place, so far as a hospitable table and profuse\\r\\ndomestic expenditure could support it.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrasting strongly with the lawyers of this period, who copied in\\r\\nminiature the impressive state of Clarendon\\'s princely establishments,\\r\\nwere the jovial, catch-singing, three-bottle lawyers--who preferred\\r\\ndrunkenness to pomp; an oaken table, surrounded by jolly fellows, to\\r\\nante-rooms crowded with obsequious courtiers; a hunting song with a\\r\\nbrave chorus to the less stormy diversion of polite conversation. Of\\r\\nthese free-living lawyers, George Jeffreys was a conspicuous leader. Not\\r\\naverse to display, and not incapable of shining in refined society, this\\r\\nnotorious man loved good cheer and jolly companions beyond all other\\r\\nsources of excitement; and during his tenure of the seals, he was never\\r\\nmore happy than when he was presiding over a company of sharp-witted\\r\\nmen-about-town whom he had invited to indulge in wild talk and choice\\r\\nwine at his mansion that overlooked the lawns, the water, and the trees\\r\\nof St. James\\'s Park. On such occasions his lordship\\'s most valued boon\\r\\ncompanion was Mountfort, the comedian, whom he had taken from the stage\\r\\nand made a permanent officer of the Duke Street household. Whether the\\r\\nactor was required to discharge any graver functions in the Chancellor\\'s\\r\\nestablishment is unknown; but we have Sir John Reresby\\'s testimony that\\r\\nthe clever mimic and brilliant libertine was employed to amuse his\\r\\nlordship\\'s guests by ridiculing the personal and mental peculiarities of\\r\\nthe judges and most eminent barristers. \"I dined,\" records Sir John,\\r\\n\"with the Lord Chancellor, where the Lord Mayor of London was a guest,\\r\\nand some other gentlemen. His lordship having, according to custom,\\r\\ndrunk deep at dinner, called for one Mountfort, a gentleman of his, who\\r\\nhad been a comedian, an excellent mimic; and to divert the company, as\\r\\nhe was pleased to term it, he made him plead before him in a feigned\\r\\ncause, during which he aped the judges, and all the great lawyers of the\\r\\nage, in tone of voice and in action and gesture of body, to the very\\r\\ngreat ridicule, not only of the lawyers, but of the law itself, which to\\r\\nme did not seem altogether prudent in a man in his lofty station in the\\r\\nlaw; diverting it certainly was, but prudent in the Lord Chancellor I\\r\\nshall never think it.\" The fun of Mountfort\\'s imitations was often\\r\\nheightened by the presence of the persons whom they held up to\\r\\nderision--some of whom would see and express natural displeasure at the\\r\\naffront; whilst others, quite unconscious of their own peculiarities,\\r\\njoined loudly in the laughter that was directed against themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs pet buffoon of the tories about town, Mountfort was followed, at a\\r\\nconsiderable distance of time, by Estcourt--an actor who united wit and\\r\\nfine humor with irresistible powers of mimicry; and who contrived to\\r\\nacquire the respect and affectionate regard of many of those famous\\r\\nWhigs whom it was alike his pleasure and his business to render\\r\\nridiculous. In the _Spectator_ Steele paid him a tribute of cordial\\r\\nadmiration; and Cibber, noticing the marvellous fidelity of his\\r\\nimitations, has recorded, \"This man was so amazing and extraordinary a\\r\\nmimic, that no man or woman, from the coquette to the privy counsellor,\\r\\never moved or spoke before him, but he could carry their voice, look,\\r\\nmien, and motion instantly into another company. I have heard him make\\r\\nlong harangues, and form various arguments, even in the manner of\\r\\nthinking of an eminent pleader at the bar, with every the least article\\r\\nand singularity of his utterance so perfectly imitated, that he was the\\r\\nvery _alter ipse_, scarce to be distinguished from the original.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of Kenyon and Eldon, and one or two less conspicuous\\r\\ninstances of judicial penuriousness, the judges of the Georgian period\\r\\nwere hospitable entertainers. Chief Justice Lee, who died in 1754,\\r\\ngained credit for an adequate knowledge of law by the sumptuousness and\\r\\nfrequency of the dinners with which he regaled his brothers of the bench\\r\\nand learned counsellors. Chief Justice Mansfield\\'s habitual temperance\\r\\nand comparative indifference to the pleasures of the table did not cause\\r\\nhim to be neglectful of hospitable duties. Notwithstanding the cold\\r\\nformality of Lord Hardwicke\\'s entertainments, and the charges of\\r\\nniggardliness preferred against Lady Hardwicke\\'s domestic system by\\r\\nOpposition satirists, Philip Yorke used to entertain the chiefs of his\\r\\nprofession with pomp, if not with affability. Thurlow entertained a\\r\\nsomewhat too limited circle of friends with English fare and a\\r\\nsuperabundance of choice port in Great Ormond Street. Throughout his\\r\\npublic career, Alexander Wedderburn was a lavish and delightful host,\\r\\namply atoning in the opinion of frivolous society for his political\\r\\nfalsity by the excellence and number of his grand dinners. On entering\\r\\nthe place of Solicitor-General, he spent £8000 on a service of plate;\\r\\nand as Lord Loughborough he gratified the bar and dazzled the\\r\\nfashionable world by hospitality alike sumptuous and brilliant.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the Georgian lawyers had strong predilections for particular\\r\\ndishes or articles of diet. Thurlow was very fanciful about his fruit;\\r\\nand in his later years he would give way to ludicrous irritability, if\\r\\ninferior grapes or faulty peaches were placed before him. At Brighton,\\r\\nin his declining years, the ex-Chancellor\\'s indignation at a dish of\\r\\ndefective wall-fruit was so lively that--to the inexpressible\\r\\nastonishment of Horne Tooke and other guests--he caused the whole of a\\r\\nvery fine dessert to be thrown out of the window upon the Marine Parade.\\r\\nBaron Graham\\'s weakness was for oysters, eaten as a preparatory whet to\\r\\nthe appetite before dinner; and it is recorded of him that on a certain\\r\\noccasion, when he had been indulging in this favorite pre-prandial\\r\\nexercise, he observed with pleasant humor--\"Oysters taken before dinner\\r\\nare said to sharpen the appetite; but I have just consumed half-a-barrel\\r\\nof fine natives--and speaking honestly, I am bound to say that I don\\'t\\r\\nfeel quite as hungry as when I began.\" Thomas Manners Button\\'s peculiar\\r\\n_penchant_ was for salads; and in a moment of impulsive kindness he gave\\r\\nLady Morgan the recipe for his favorite salad--a compound of rare merit\\r\\nand mysterious properties. Bitterly did the old lawyer repent his unwise\\r\\nmunificence when he read \\'O\\'Donnell.\\' Warmly displeased with the\\r\\npolitical sentiments of the novel, he ordered it to be burnt in the\\r\\nservants\\' hall, and exclaimed, peevishly, to Lady Manners, \"I wish I\\r\\nhad not given her the secret of my salad.\" In no culinary product did\\r\\nLord Ellenborough find greater delight than lobster-sauce; and he gave\\r\\nexpression to his high regard for that soothing and delicate compound\\r\\nwhen he decided that persons engaged in lobster-fishery were exempt from\\r\\nlegal liability to impressment. \"Then is not,\" inquired his lordship,\\r\\nwith solemn pathos, \"the lobster-fishery a fishery, and a most important\\r\\nfishery, of this kingdom, though carried on in shallow water? The\\r\\nframers of the law well knew that the produce of the deep sea, without\\r\\nthe produce of the shallow water, would be of comparatively small value,\\r\\nand intended that turbot, when placed upon our tables, should be flanked\\r\\nby good lobster-sauce.\" Eldon\\'s singular passion for fried \\'liver and\\r\\nbacon\\' was amongst his most notorious and least pleasant peculiarities.\\r\\nEven the Prince Regent condescended to humor this remarkable taste by\\r\\nordering a dish of liver and bacon to be placed on the table when the\\r\\nChancellor dined with him at Brighton. Sir John Leach, Master of the\\r\\nRolls, was however less ready to pander to a depraved appetite. Lord\\r\\nEldon said, \"It will give me great pleasure to dine with you, and since\\r\\nyou are good enough to ask me to order a dish that shall test your new\\r\\n_chef\\'s_ powers--I wish you\\'d tell your Frenchman to fry some liver and\\r\\nbacon for me.\" \"Are you laughing at me or my cook?\" asked Sir John\\r\\nLeach, stiffly, thinking that the Chancellor was bent on ridiculing his\\r\\nluxurious mode of living. \"At neither,\" answered Eldon, with equal\\r\\nsimplicity and truth; \"I was only ordering the dish which I enjoy beyond\\r\\nall other dishes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Eldon\\'s penuriousness was grossly exaggerated by his\\r\\ndetractors, it cannot be questioned that either through indolence, or\\r\\nlove of money, or some other kind of selfishness, he was very neglectful\\r\\nof his hospitable duties to the bench and the bar. \"Verily he is\\r\\nworking off the arrears of the Lord Chancellor,\" said Romilly, when Sir\\r\\nThomas Plummer, the Master of the Rolls, gave a succession of dinners to\\r\\nthe bar; and such a remark would not have escaped the lips of the\\r\\ndecorous and amiable Romilly had not circumstances fully justified it.\\r\\nStill it is unquestionable that Eldon\\'s Cabinet dinners were suitably\\r\\nexpensive; and that he never grudged his choicest port to the old\\r\\nattorneys and subordinate placemen who were his obsequious companions\\r\\ntowards the close of his career. For the charges of sordid parsimony so\\r\\nfrequently preferred against Kenyon it is to be feared there were better\\r\\ngrounds. Under the steadily strengthening spell of avarice he ceased to\\r\\ninvite even old friends to his table; and it was rumored that in course\\r\\nof time his domestic servants complained with reason that they were\\r\\nrequired to consume the same fare as their master deemed sufficient for\\r\\nhimself. \"In Lord Kenyon\\'s house,\" a wit exclaimed, \"all the year\\r\\nthrough it is Lent in the kitchen, and Passion Week in the Parlor.\"\\r\\nAnother caustic quidnunc remarked, \"In his lordship\\'s kitchen the fire\\r\\nis dull, but the spits are always bright;\" whereupon Jekyll interposed\\r\\nwith an assumption of testiness, \"Spits! in the name of common sense I\\r\\norder you not to talk about _his_ spits, for nothing turns upon them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVery different was the temper of Erskine, who spent money faster than\\r\\nKenyon saved it, and who died in indigence after holding the Great Seal\\r\\nof England, and making for many years a finer income at the bar than any\\r\\nof his contemporaries not enjoying crown patronage. Many are the bright\\r\\npictures preserved to us of his hospitality to politicians and lawyers,\\r\\nwits, and people of fashion; but none of the scenes is more\\r\\ncharacteristic than the dinner described by Sir Samuel Romilly, when\\r\\nthat good man met at Erskine\\'s Hampstead villa the chiefs of the\\r\\nopposition and Mr. Pinkney, the American Minister. \"Among the light,\\r\\ntrifling topics of conversation after dinner,\" says Sir Samuel Romilly,\\r\\n\"it may be worth while to mention one, as it strongly characterizes Lord\\r\\nErskine. He has always expressed and felt a strong sympathy with\\r\\nanimals. He has talked for years of a bill he was to bring into\\r\\nparliament to prevent cruelty towards them. He has always had some\\r\\nfavorite animals to whom he has been much attached, and of whom all his\\r\\nacquaintance have a number of anecdotes to relate; a favorite dog which\\r\\nhe used to bring, when he was at the bar, to all his consultations;\\r\\nanother favorite dog, which, at the time when he was Lord Chancellor, he\\r\\nhimself rescued in the street from some boys who were about to kill it\\r\\nunder the pretence of its being mad; a favorite goose, which followed\\r\\nhim wherever he walked about his grounds; a favorite macaw, and other\\r\\ndumb favorites without number. He told us now that he had got two\\r\\nfavorite leeches. He had been blooded by them last autumn when he had\\r\\nbeen taken dangerously ill at Portsmouth; they had saved his life, and\\r\\nhe had brought them with him to town, had ever since kept them in a\\r\\nglass, had himself every day given them fresh water, and had formed a\\r\\nfriendship for them. He said he was sure they both knew him and were\\r\\ngrateful to him. He had given them different names, \\'Home\\' and \\'Cline\\'\\r\\n(the names of two celebrated surgeons), their dispositions being quite\\r\\ndifferent. After a good deal of conversation about them, he went\\r\\nhimself, brought them out of his library, and placed them in their glass\\r\\nupon the table. It is impossible, however, without the vivacity, the\\r\\ntones, the details, and the gestures of Lord Erskine, to give an\\r\\nadequate idea of this singular scene.\" Amongst the listeners to Erskine,\\r\\nwhilst he spoke eloquently and with fervor of the virtues of his two\\r\\nleeches, were the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Grenville, Lord Grey, Lord\\r\\nHolland, Lord Ellenborough, Lord Lauderdale, Lord Henry Petty, and\\r\\nThomas Grenville.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nWINE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the time when Francis Bacon attributed a sharp attack of gout to\\r\\nhis removal from Gray\\'s Inn Fields to the river side, to a time not many\\r\\nyears distant when Sir Herbert Jenner Fust[36] used to be brought into\\r\\nhis court in Doctors\\' Commons and placed in the judicial seat by two\\r\\nliveried porters, lawyers were not remarkable for abstinence from the\\r\\npleasures to which our ancestors were indebted for the joint-fixing,\\r\\npicturesque gout that has already become an affair of the past.\\r\\nThroughout the long period that lies between Charles II.\\'s restoration\\r\\nand George III.\\'s death, an English judge without a symptom of gout was\\r\\nso exceptional a character that people talked of him as an interesting\\r\\nsocial curiosity. The Merry Monarch made Clarendon\\'s bedroom his\\r\\ncouncil-chamber when the Chancellor was confined to his couch by\\r\\n_podagra_. Lord Nottingham was so disabled by gout, and what the old\\r\\nphysicians were pleased to call a \\'perversity of the humors,\\' that his\\r\\nduties in the House of Lords were often discharged by Francis North,\\r\\nthen Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; and though he persevered in\\r\\nattending to the business of his court, a man of less resolution would\\r\\nhave altogether succumbed to the agony of his disease and the burden of\\r\\nhis infirmities. \"I have known him,\" says Roger North, \"sit to hear\\r\\npetitions in great pain, and say that his servants had let him out,\\r\\nthough he was fitter for his chamber.\" Prudence saved Lord Guildford\\r\\nfrom excessive intemperance; but he lived with a freedom that would be\\r\\nremarkable in the present age. Chief Justice Saunders was a confirmed\\r\\nsot, taking nips of brandy with his breakfast, and seldom appearing in\\r\\npublic \"without a pot of ale at his nose or near him.\" Sir Robert Wright\\r\\nwas notoriously addicted to wine; and George Jeffreys drank, as he\\r\\nswore, like a trooper. \"My lord,\" said King Charles, in a significant\\r\\ntone, when he gave Jeffreys the _blood-stone_ ring, \"as it is a hot\\r\\nsummer, and you are going the circuit, I desire you will not drink too\\r\\nmuch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the reeling judges of the Restoration, however, there moved one\\r\\nvenerable lawyer, who, in an age when moralists hesitated to call\\r\\ndrunkenness a vice, was remarkable for sobriety. In his youth, whilst he\\r\\nwas indulging with natural ardor in youthful pleasures, Chief Justice\\r\\nHale was so struck with horror at seeing an intimate friend drop\\r\\nsenseless, and apparently lifeless, at a student\\'s drinking-bout, that\\r\\nhe made a sudden but enduring resolution to conquer his ebrious\\r\\npropensities, and withdraw himself from the dangerous allurements of\\r\\nungodly company. Falling upon his knees he prayed the Almighty to\\r\\nrescue his friend from the jaws of death, and also to strengthen him to\\r\\nkeep his newly-formed resolution. He rose an altered man. But in an age\\r\\nwhen the barbarous usage of toast-drinking was in full force, he felt\\r\\nthat he could not be an habitually sober man if he mingled in society,\\r\\nand obeyed a rule which required the man of delicate and excitable\\r\\nnerves to drink as much, bumper for bumper, as the man whose sluggish\\r\\nsystem could receive a quart of spirits at a sitting and yet scarcely\\r\\nexperience a change of sensation. At that time it was customary with\\r\\nprudent men to protect themselves against a pernicious and tyrannous\\r\\ncustom, by taking a vow to abstain from toast-drinking, or even from\\r\\ndrinking wine at all, for a certain stated period. Readers do not need\\r\\nto be reminded how often young Pepys was under a vow not to drink; and\\r\\nthe device by which the jovial admiralty clerk strengthened an infirm\\r\\nwill and defended himself against temptation was frequently employed by\\r\\nright-minded young men of his date. In some cases, instead of _vowing_\\r\\nnot to drink, they _bound_ themselves not to drink within a certain\\r\\nperiod; two persons, that is to say, agreeing that they would abstain\\r\\nfrom wine and spirits for a certain period, and each _binding_ himself\\r\\nin case he broke the compact to pay over a certain sum of money to his\\r\\npartner in the bond. Young Hale saw that to effect a complete\\r\\nreformation of his life it was needful for him to abjure the practice of\\r\\ndrinking healths. He therefore vowed _never again_ to drink a health;\\r\\nand he kept his vow. Never again did he brim his bumper and drain it at\\r\\nthe command of a toast-master, although his abstinence exposed him to\\r\\nmuch annoyance; and in his old age he thus urged his grandchildren to\\r\\nfollow his example--\"I will not have you begin or pledge any health, for\\r\\nit is become one of the greatest artifices of drinking, and occasions of\\r\\nquarrelling in the kingdom. If you pledge one health you oblige\\r\\nyourself to pledge another, and a third, and so onwards; and if you\\r\\npledge as many as will be drunk, you must be debauched and drunk. If\\r\\nthey will needs know the reason of your refusal, it is a fair answer,\\r\\n\\'that your grandfather that brought you up, from whom, under God, you\\r\\nhave the estate you enjoy or expect, left this in command with you, that\\r\\nyou should never begin or pledge a health.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJeffrey\\'s _protégé_, John Trevor, liked good wine himself, but emulated\\r\\nthe virtuous Hale in the pains which he took to place the treacherous\\r\\ndrink beyond the reach of others--whenever they showed a desire to drink\\r\\nit at his expense. After his expulsion from the House of Commons, Sir\\r\\nJohn Trevor was sitting alone over a choice bottle of claret, when his\\r\\nneedy kinsman, Roderic Lloyd, was announced. \"You rascal,\" exclaimed the\\r\\nMaster of the Rolls, springing to his feet, and attacking his footman\\r\\nwith furious language, \"you have brought my cousin, Roderic Lloyd,\\r\\nEsquire, Prothonotary of North Wales, Marshal to Baron Price, up my back\\r\\nstairs. You scoundrel, hear ye, I order you to take him this instant\\r\\ndown my _back stairs_, and bring him up my _front stairs_.\" Sir John\\r\\nmade such a point of showing his visitor this mark of respect, that the\\r\\nyoung barrister was forced to descend and enter the room by the state\\r\\nstaircase; but he saw no reason to think himself honored by his cousin\\'s\\r\\npunctilious courtesy, when on entering the room a second time he looked\\r\\nin vain for the claret bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn another occasion Sir John Trevor\\'s official residence afforded\\r\\nshelter to the same poor relation when the latter was in great mental\\r\\ntrouble. \"Roderic,\" saith the chronicler, \"was returning rather elevated\\r\\nfrom his club one night, and ran against the pump in Chancery Lane.\\r\\nConceiving somebody had struck him, he drew and made a lunge at the\\r\\npump. The sword entered the spout, and the pump, being crazy, fell\\r\\ndown. Roderic concluded he had killed his man, left, his sword in the\\r\\npump, and retreated to his old friend\\'s house at the Rolls. There he was\\r\\nconcealed by the servants for the night. In the morning his Honor,\\r\\nhaving heard the story, came himself to deliver him from his\\r\\nconsternation and confinement in the coal-hole.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the eighteenth century lawyers there was considerable difference\\r\\nof taste and opinion on questions relating to the use and abuse of wine.\\r\\nThough he never, or very seldom, exceeded the limits of sobriety, Somers\\r\\nenjoyed a bottle in congenial society; and though wine never betrayed\\r\\nhim into reckless hilarity, it gave gentleness and comity to his\\r\\nhabitually severe countenance and solemn deportment--if reliance may be\\r\\nplaced on Swift\\'s couplet--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"By force of wine even Scarborough is brave,\\r\\n   Hall grows more pert, and Somers not so grave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA familiar quotation that alludes to Murray\\'s early intercourse with the\\r\\nwits warrants an inference that in opening manhood he preferred\\r\\nchampagne to every other wine; but as Lord Mansfield he steadily adhered\\r\\nto claret, though fashion had taken into favor the fuller wine\\r\\nstigmatized as poison by John Home\\'s famous epigram--\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Bold and erect the Caledonian stood;\\r\\n   Old was his mutton, and his claret good.\\r\\n   \\'Let him drink port,\\' an English statesman cried:\\r\\n   He drunk the poison and his spirit died.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike his father, who never sinned against moderation in his cups,\\r\\nCharles Yorke was a deep drinker as well as a gourmand. Hardwicke\\'s\\r\\nsuccessor, Lord Northington, was the first of a line of\\r\\nport-wine-drinking judges that may at the present time be fairly said\\r\\nto have come to an end--although a few reverend fathers of the law yet\\r\\nremain, who drink with relish the Methuen drink when age has deprived it\\r\\nof body and strength. Until Robert Henley held the seals, Chancellors\\r\\ncontinued to hold after-dinner sittings in the Court of Chancery on\\r\\ncertain days of the week throughout term. Hardwicke, throughout his long\\r\\nofficial career, sat on the evenings of Wednesdays and Fridays hearing\\r\\ncauses, while men of pleasure were fuddling themselves with fruity\\r\\nvintages. Lord Northington, however, prevailed on George III. to let him\\r\\ndiscontinue these evening attendances in court. \"But why,\" asked the\\r\\nmonarch, \"do you wish for a change?\" \"Sir,\" the Chancellor answered,\\r\\nwith delightful frankness, \"I want the change in order that I may finish\\r\\nmy bottle of port at my ease; and your majesty, in your parental care\\r\\nfor the happiness of your subjects, will, I trust, think this a\\r\\nsufficient reason.\" Of course the king\\'s laughter ended in a favorable\\r\\nanswer to the petition for reform, and from that time the Chancellor\\'s\\r\\nevening sittings were discontinued. But ere he died, the jovial\\r\\nChancellor paid the penalty which port exacts from all her fervent\\r\\nworshippers, and he suffered the acutest pangs of gout. It is recorded\\r\\nthat as he limped from the woolsack to the bar of the House of Lords, he\\r\\nonce muttered to a young peer, who watched his distress with evident\\r\\nsympathy--\"Ah, my young friend, if I had known that these legs would one\\r\\nday carry a Chancellor, I would have taken better care of them when I\\r\\nwas at your age.\" Unto this had come the handsome legs of young\\r\\nCounsellor Henley, who, in his dancing days, stepped minuets to the\\r\\nenthusiastic admiration of the _belles_ of Bath.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome light is thrown on the manners of lawyers in the eighteenth century\\r\\nby an order made by the authorities of Barnard\\'s Inn, who, in November,\\r\\n1706, named two quarts as the allowance of wine to be given to each\\r\\nmess of four men by two gentlemen on going through the ceremony of\\r\\n\\'initiation.\\' Of course, this amount of wine was an \\'extra\\' allowance,\\r\\nin addition to the ale and sherry assigned to members by the regular\\r\\ndietary of the house. Even Sheridan, who boasted that he could drink any\\r\\n_given_ quantity of wine, would have thought twice before he drank so\\r\\nlarge a given quantity, in addition to a liberal allowance of stimulant.\\r\\nAnyhow, the quantity was fixed--a fact that would have elicited an\\r\\nexpression of approval from Chief Baron Thompson, who, loving port wine\\r\\nwisely, though too well, expressed at the same time his concurrence with\\r\\nthe words, and his dissent from the opinion of a barrister, who\\r\\nobserved--\"I hold, my lord, that after a good dinner a certain quantity\\r\\nof wine does no harm.\" With a smile, the Chief Baron rejoined--\"True,\\r\\nsir; it is the _uncertain_ quantity that does the mischief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most temperate of the eighteenth-century Chancellors was Lord\\r\\nCamden, who required no more generous beverage than sound malt liquor,\\r\\nas he candidly declared, in a letter to the Duke of Grafton, wherein he\\r\\nsays--\"I am, thank God, remarkably well, but your grace must not seduce\\r\\nme into my former intemperance. A plain dish and a draught of porter\\r\\n(which last is indispensable), are the very extent of my luxury.\" For\\r\\nporter, Edward Thurlow, in his student days, had high respect and keen\\r\\nrelish; but in his mature years, as well as still older age, full-bodied\\r\\nport was his favorite drink, and under its influence were seen to the\\r\\nbest advantage those colloquial powers which caused Samuel Johnson to\\r\\nexclaim--\"Depend upon it, sir, it is when you come close to a man in\\r\\nconversation that you discover what his real abilities are; to make a\\r\\nspeech in a public assembly is a knack. Now, I honor Thurlow, sir;\\r\\nThurlow is a fine fellow: he fairly puts his mind to yours.\" Of\\r\\nThurlow, when he had mounted the woolsack, Johnson also observed--\"I\\r\\nwould prepare myself for no man in England but Lord Thurlow. When I am\\r\\nto meet him, I would wish to know a day before.\" From the many stories\\r\\ntold of Thurlow and ebriosity, one may be here taken and brought under\\r\\nthe reader\\'s notice--not because it has wit or humor to recommend it,\\r\\nbut because it presents the Chancellor in company with another\\r\\nport-loving lawyer, William Pitt, from whose fame, by-the-by, Lord\\r\\nStanhope has recently removed the old disfiguring imputations of\\r\\nsottishness. \"Returning,\" says Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, a poor authority,\\r\\nbut piquant gossip-monger, \"by way of frolic, very late at night, on\\r\\nhorseback, to Wimbledon, from Addiscombe, the seat of Mr. Jenkinson,\\r\\nnear Croydon, where the party had dined, Lord Thurlow, the Chancellor,\\r\\nPitt, and Dundas, found the turnpike gate, situate between Tooting and\\r\\nStreatham, thrown open. Being elevated above their usual prudence, and\\r\\nhaving no servant near them, they passed through the gate at a brisk\\r\\npace, without stopping to pay the toll, regardless of the remonstrances\\r\\nand threats of the turnpike man, who running after them, and believing\\r\\nthem to belong to some highwaymen who had recently committed some\\r\\ndepredation on that road, discharged the contents of his blunderbuss at\\r\\ntheir backs. Happily he did no injury.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout their long lives the brothers Scott were steady, and,\\r\\naccording to the rules of the present day, inordinate drinkers of port\\r\\nwine. As a young barrister, John Scott could carry more port with\\r\\ndecorum than any other man of his inn; and in the days when he is\\r\\ngenerally supposed to have lived on sprats and table-beer, he seldom\\r\\npassed twenty-four hours without a bottle of his favorite wine.\\r\\nPrudence, however, made him careful to avoid intoxication, and when he\\r\\nfound that a friendship often betrayed him into what he thought\\r\\nexcessive drinking, he withdrew from the dangerous connexion. \"I see\\r\\nyour friend Bowes very often,\" he wrote in May, 1778, a time when Mr.\\r\\nBowes was his most valuable client; \"but I dare not dine with him above\\r\\nonce in three months, as there is no getting away before midnight; and,\\r\\nindeed, one is sure to be in a condition in which no man would wish to\\r\\nbe in the streets at any other season.\" Of the quantities imbibed at\\r\\nthese three-monthly dinners, an estimate may be formed from the\\r\\nfollowing story. Bringing from Oxford to London that fine sense of the\\r\\nmerits of port wine which characterized the thorough Oxonion of a\\r\\ncentury since, William Scott made it for some years a rule to dine with\\r\\nhis brother John on the first day of term at a tavern hard by the\\r\\nTemple; and on these occasions the brothers used to make away with\\r\\nbottle after bottle not less to the astonishment than the approval of\\r\\nthe waiters who served them. Before the decay of his faculties, Lord\\r\\nStowell was recalling these terminal dinners to his son-in-law, Lord\\r\\nSidmouth, when the latter observed, \"You drank some wine together, I\\r\\ndare say?\" Lord Stowell, modestly, \"Yes, we drank some wine.\"\\r\\nSon-in-law, inquisitively, \"Two bottles?\" Lord Stowell, quickly putting\\r\\naway the imputation of such abstemiousness, \"More than that.\"\\r\\nSon-in-law, smiling, \"What, three bottles?\" Lord Stowell, \"More.\"\\r\\nSon-in-law, opening his eyes with astonishment, \"By Jove, sir, you don\\'t\\r\\nmean to say that you took four bottles?\" Lord Stowell, beginning to feel\\r\\nashamed of himself, \"More; I mean to say we had more. Now don\\'t ask any\\r\\nmore questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst Lord Stowell, smarting under the domestic misery of which his\\r\\nfoolish marriage with the Dowager Marchioness of Sligo was fruitful,\\r\\nsought comfort and forgetfulness in the cellar of the Middle Temple,\\r\\nLord Eldon drained magnums of Newcastle port at his own table. Populous\\r\\nwith wealthy merchants, and surrounded by an opulent aristocracy,\\r\\nNewcastle had used the advantages given her by a large export trade with\\r\\nPortugal to draw to her cellars such superb port wine as could be found\\r\\nin no other town in the United Kingdom; and to the last the Tory\\r\\nChancellor used to get his port from the canny capital of Northumbria.\\r\\nJust three weeks before his death, the veteran lawyer, sitting in his\\r\\neasy-chair and recalling his early triumphs, preluded an account of the\\r\\ngreat leading case, \"Akroyd _v._ Smithson,\" by saying to his listener,\\r\\n\"Come, Farrer, help yourself to a glass of Newcastle port, and help me\\r\\nto a little.\" But though he asked for a little, the old earl, according\\r\\nto his wont, drank much before he was raised from his chair and led to\\r\\nhis sleeping-room. It is on record, and is moreover supported by\\r\\nunexceptionable evidence, that in his extreme old age, whilst he was\\r\\ncompletely laid upon the shelf, and almost down to the day of his death,\\r\\nwhich occurred in his eighty-seventh year, Lord Eldon never drank less\\r\\nthan three pints of port daily with or after his dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf eminent lawyers who were steady port-wine drinkers, Baron Platt--the\\r\\namiable and popular judge who died in 1862, aged seventy-two years--may\\r\\nbe regarded as one of the last. Of him it is recorded that in early\\r\\nmanhood he was so completely prostrated by severe illness that beholders\\r\\njudged him to be actually dead. Standing over his silent body shortly\\r\\nbefore the arrival of the undertaker, two of his friends concurred in\\r\\ngiving utterance to the sentiment: \"Ah, poor dear fellow, we shall never\\r\\ndrink a glass of wine with him again;\" when, to their momentary alarm\\r\\nand subsequent delight, the dead man interposed with a faint assumption\\r\\nof jocularity, \"But you will though, and a good many too, I hope.\" When\\r\\nthe undertaker called he was sent away a genuinely sorrowful man; and\\r\\nthe young lawyer, who was \\'not dead yet,\\' lived to old age and good\\r\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n[36] In old Sir Herbert\\'s later days it was a mere pleasantry, or bold\\r\\nfigure of speech to say that his court had risen, for he used to be\\r\\nlifted from his chair and carried bodily from the chamber of justice by\\r\\ntwo brawny footmen. Of course, as soon as the judge was about to be\\r\\nelevated by his bearers, the bar rose; and also as a matter of course\\r\\nthe bar continued to stand until the strong porters had conveyed their\\r\\nweighty and venerable burden along the platform behind one of the rows\\r\\nof advocates and out of sight. As the _trio_ worked their laborious way\\r\\nalong the platform, there seemed to be some danger that they might\\r\\nblunder and fall through one of the windows into the space behind the\\r\\ncourt; and at a time when Sir Herbert and Dr. ---- were at open\\r\\nvariance, that waspish advocate had on one occasion the bad taste to\\r\\nkeep his seat at the rising of the court, and with characteristic\\r\\nmalevolence of expression to say to the footmen, \"Mind, my men, and take\\r\\ncare of that judge of yours--or, by Jove, you\\'ll pitch him out of the\\r\\nwindow.\" It is needless to say that this brutal speech did not raise the\\r\\nspeaker in the opinion of the hearers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAW AND LITERATURE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the present time, when three out of every five journalists attached\\r\\nto our chief London newspapers are Inns-of-Court men; when many of our\\r\\nable and successful advocates are known to ply their pens in organs of\\r\\nperiodical literature as regularly as they raise their voices in courts\\r\\nof justice; and when the young Templar, who has borne away the first\\r\\nhonors of his university, deems himself the object of a compliment on\\r\\nreceiving an invitation to contribute to the columns of a leading review\\r\\nor daily journal--it is difficult to believe that strong men are still\\r\\namongst us who can remember the days when it was the fashion of the bar\\r\\nto disdain law-students who were suspected of \\'writing for hire\\' and\\r\\nbarristers who \\'reported for the papers.\\' Throughout the opening years\\r\\nof the present century, and even much later, it was almost universally\\r\\nheld on the circuits and in Westminster Hall, that Inns-of-Court men\\r\\nlowered the dignity of their order by following those literary\\r\\navocations by which some of the brightest ornaments of the law supported\\r\\nthemselves at the outset of their professional careers. Notwithstanding\\r\\nthis prejudice, a few wearers of the long robe, daring by nature, or\\r\\nrendered bold by necessity, persisted in \\'maintaining a connexion with\\r\\nthe press, whilst they sought briefs on the circuit, or waited for\\r\\nclients in their chambers. Such men as Sergeant Spankie and Lord\\r\\nCampbell, as Master Stephen and Mr. Justice Talfourd, were reporters for\\r\\nthe press whilst they kept terms; and no sooner had Henry Brougham\\'s\\r\\neloquence charmed the public, than it was whispered that for years his\\r\\npen, no less ready than his tongue, had found constant employment in\\r\\norgans of political intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though such men were known to exist, they were regarded as the\\r\\n\\'black sheep\\' of the bar by a great majority of their profession. It is\\r\\nnot improbable that this prejudice against gownsmen on the press was\\r\\npalliated by circumstances that no longer exist. When political writers\\r\\nwere very generally regarded as dangerous members of society, and when\\r\\nconductors of respectable newspapers were harassed with vexatious\\r\\nprosecutions and heavy punishments for acts of trivial inadvertence, or\\r\\nfor purely imaginary offences, the average journalist was in many\\r\\nrespects inferior to the average journalist working under the present\\r\\nmore favorable circumstances. Men of culture, honest purpose, and fine\\r\\nfeeling were slow to enrol themselves members of a despised and\\r\\nproscribed fraternity; and in the dearth of educated gentlemen ready to\\r\\naccept literary employment, the task of writing for the public papers\\r\\ntoo frequently devolved upon very unscrupulous persons, who rendered\\r\\ntheir calling as odious as themselves. A shackled and persecuted press\\r\\nis always a licentious and venal press; and before legislation endowed\\r\\nEnglish journalism with a certain measure of freedom and security, it\\r\\nwas seldom manly and was often corrupt. It is therefore probable that\\r\\nour grandfathers had some show of reason for their dislike of\\r\\ncontributors to anonymous literature. At the bar men of unquestionable\\r\\namiability and enlightenment were often the loudest to express this\\r\\naversion for their scribbling brethren. It was said that the scribblers\\r\\nwere seldom gentlemen in temper; and that they never hesitated to puff\\r\\nthemselves in their papers. These considerations so far influenced Mr.\\r\\nJustice Lawrence that, though he was a model of judicial suavity to all\\r\\nother members of the bar, he could never bring himself to be barely\\r\\ncivil to advocates known to be \\'upon the press.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Lincoln\\'s Inn this strong feeling against journalists found vent in a\\r\\nresolution, framed in reference to a particular person, which would have\\r\\nshut out journalists from the Society. It had long been understood that\\r\\nno student could be called to the bar _whilst_ he was acting as a\\r\\nreporter in the gallery of either house; but the new decision of the\\r\\nbenchers would have destroyed the ancient connexion of the legal\\r\\nprofession and literary calling. Strange to say this illiberal measure\\r\\nwas the work of two benchers who, notwithstanding their patrician\\r\\ndescent and associations, were vehement asserters of liberal principles.\\r\\nMr. Clifford--\\'O.P.\\' Clifford--was its proposer and Erskine was its\\r\\nseconder. Fortunately the person who was the immediate object of its\\r\\nprovisions petitioned the House of Commons upon the subject, and the\\r\\nconsequent debate in the Lower House decided the benchers to withdraw\\r\\nfrom their false position; and since their silent retreat no attempt has\\r\\nbeen made by any of the four honorable societies to affix an undeserved\\r\\nstigma on the followers of a serviceable art. Upon the whole the\\r\\nliterary calling gained much from the discreditable action of Lincoln\\'s\\r\\nInn; for the speech in which Sheridan covered with derision this attempt\\r\\nto brand parliamentary reporters as unfit to associate with members of\\r\\nthe bar, and the address in which Mr. Stephen, with manly reference to\\r\\nhis own early experiences, warmly censured the conduct of the society of\\r\\nwhich he was himself a member, caused many persons to form a new and\\r\\njuster estimate of the working members of the London press. Having\\r\\nalluded to Dr. Johnson and Edmund Burke, who had both acted as\\r\\nparliamentary reporters, Sheridan stated that no less than twenty-three\\r\\ngraduates of universities were then engaged as reporters of the\\r\\nproceedings of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe close connexion which for centuries has existed between men of law\\r\\nand men of letters is illustrated on the one hand by a long succession\\r\\nof eminent lawyers who have added to the lustre of professional honors\\r\\nthe no less bright distinctions of literary achievements or friendships,\\r\\nand on the other hand by the long line of able writers who either\\r\\nenrolled themselves amongst the students of the law, or resided in the\\r\\nInns of Court, or cherished with assiduous care the friendly regard of\\r\\nfamous judges. Indeed, since the days of Chancellor de Bury, who wrote\\r\\nthe \\'Philobiblon,\\' there have been few Chancellors to whom literature is\\r\\nnot in some way indebted; and the few Keepers of the Seal who neither\\r\\ncared for letters nor cultivated the society of students, are amongst\\r\\nthe judges whose names most Englishmen would gladly erase from the\\r\\nhistory of their country. Jeffreys and Macclesfield represent the\\r\\nunlettered Chancellors; More and Bacon the lettered. Fortescue\\'s \\'De\\r\\nLaudibus\\' is a book for every reader. To Chancellor Warham, Erasmus--a\\r\\nscholar not given to distribute praise carelessly--dedicated his \\'St.\\r\\nJerom,\\' with cordial eulogy. Wolsey was a patron of letters. More may be\\r\\nsaid to have revived, if he did not create, the literary taste of his\\r\\ncontemporaries, and to have transplanted the novel to English soil.\\r\\nEqually diligent as a writer and a collector of books, Gardyner spent\\r\\nhis happiest moments at his desk, or over the folios of the magnificent\\r\\nlibrary which was destroyed by Wyat\\'s insurgents. Christopher Hatton was\\r\\na dramatic author. To one person who can describe with any approach to\\r\\naccuracy Edward Hyde\\'s conduct in the Court of Chancery, there are\\r\\ntwenty who have studied Clarendon\\'s \\'Rebellion.\\' At the present date\\r\\nHale\\'s books are better known than his judgments, though his conduct\\r\\ntowards the witches of Bury St. Edmunds conferred an unenviable fame on\\r\\nhis judicial career. By timely assistance rendered to Burnet, Lord\\r\\nNottingham did something to atone for his brutality towards Milton,\\r\\nwhom, at an earlier period of his career, he had declared worthy of a\\r\\nfelon\\'s death, for having been Cromwell\\'s Latin secretary. Lord Keeper\\r\\nNorth wrote upon \\'Music;\\' and to his brother Roger literature is\\r\\nindebted for the best biographies composed by any writer of his period.\\r\\nIn his boyhood Somers was a poet; in his maturer years the friend of\\r\\npoets. The friend of Prior and Gay, Arbuthnot and Pope, Lord Chancellor\\r\\nHarcourt, wrote verses of more than ordinary merit, and alike in periods\\r\\nof official triumph and in times of retirement valued the friendship of\\r\\nmen of wit above the many successes of his public career. Lord\\r\\nChancellor King, author of \\'Constitution and Discipline of the Primitive\\r\\nChurch,\\' was John Locke\\'s dutiful nephew and favorite companion. King\\'s\\r\\nimmediate successor was extolled by Pope in the lines,\\r\\n\\r\\n   O teach us, Talbot! thou\\'rt unspoil\\'d by wealth,\\r\\n   That secret rare, between the extremes to move,\\r\\n   Of mad good-nature and of mean self-love.\\r\\n   Who is it copies Talbot\\'s better part,\\r\\n   To ease th\\' oppress\\'d, and raise the sinking heart?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Talbot\\'s fairest eulogy was penned by his son\\'s tutor, Alexander\\r\\nThomson--a poet who had no reason to feel gratitude to Talbot\\'s official\\r\\nsuccessor. Ere he thoroughly resolved to devote himself to law, the cold\\r\\nand formal Hardwicke had cherished a feeble ambition for literary\\r\\ndistinction; and under its influence he wrote a paper that appeared in\\r\\nthe _Spectator_. Blackstone\\'s entrance at the Temple occasioned his\\r\\nmetrical \\'Farewell\\' to his muse. In his undergraduate days at Cambridge\\r\\nLord Chancellor Charles Yorke was a chief contributor to the \\'Athenian\\r\\nLetters,\\' and it would have been well for him had he in after-life given\\r\\nto letters a portion of the time which he sacrificed to ambition.\\r\\nThurlow\\'s churlishness and overbearing temper are at this date trifling\\r\\nmatters in comparison with his friendship for Cowper and Samuel Johnson,\\r\\nand his kindly aid to George Crabbe. Even more than for the wisdom of\\r\\nhis judgments Mansfield is remembered for his intimacy with \\'the wits,\\'\\r\\nand his close friendship with that chief of them all, who exclaimed,\\r\\n\"How sweet an Ovid, Murray, was our boast,\" and in honor of that \"Sweet\\r\\nOvid\" penned the lines,\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Graced as thou art, with all the power of words,\\r\\n   So known, so honored in the House of Lords\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nverses deliciously ridiculed by the parodist who wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"Persuasion tips his tongue whene\\'er he talks:\\r\\n   And he has chambers in the King\\'s Bench walks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an atonement for many defects, Alexander Wedderburn had one\\r\\nvirtue--an honest respect for letters that made him in opening manhood\\r\\nseek the friendship of Hume, at a later date solicit a pension for Dr.\\r\\nJohnson, and after his elevation to the woolsack overwhelm Gibbon with\\r\\nhospitable civilities. Eldon was an Oxford Essayist in his young, the\\r\\ncompiler of \\'The Anecdote Book\\' in his old days; and though he cannot be\\r\\ncommended for literary tastes, or sympathy with men of letters, he was\\r\\none of the many great lawyers who found pleasure in the conversation of\\r\\nSamuel Johnson. Unlike his brother, Lord Stowell clung fast to his\\r\\nliterary friendships, as \\'Dr. Scott of the Commons\\' priding himself more\\r\\non his membership in the Literary Club than on his standing in the\\r\\nPrerogative Court; and as Lord Stowell evincing cordial respect for the\\r\\nsuccessors of Reynolds and Malone, even when love of money had taken\\r\\nfirm hold of his enfeebled mind. Archdeacon Paley\\'s London residence was\\r\\nin Edward Law\\'s house in Bloomsbury Square. In Erskine literary ambition\\r\\nwas so strong that, not content with the fame brought to him by\\r\\nexcellent _vers de société_, he took pen in hand when he resigned the\\r\\nseals, and--more to the delight of his enemies than the satisfaction of\\r\\nhis friends--wrote a novel, which neither became, nor deserved to be,\\r\\npermanently successful. With similar zeal and greater ability the\\r\\nliterary reputation of the bar has been maintained by Lord Denman, who\\r\\nwas an industrious _littérateur_ whilst he was working his way up at the\\r\\nbar; by Sir John Taylor Coleridge, whose services to the _Quarterly\\r\\nReview_ are an affair of literary history; by Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd,\\r\\nwho, having reported in the gallery, lived to lake part in the debates\\r\\nof the House of Commons, and who, from the date of his first engagement\\r\\non the _Times_ till the sad morning when \"God\\'s finger touched him,\"\\r\\nwhile he sat upon the bench, never altogether relinquished those\\r\\nliterary pursuits, in which he earned well-merited honor; by Lord\\r\\nMacaulay, whose connexion with the legal profession is almost lost sight\\r\\nof in the brilliance of his literary renown; by Lord Campbell, who\\r\\ndreamt of living to wear an SS collar in Westminster Hall whilst he was\\r\\nmerely John Campbell the reporter; by Lord Brougham, who, having\\r\\ninstructed our grandfathers with his pen, still remains upon the stage,\\r\\ngiving their grandsons wise lessons with his tongue; and by Lord\\r\\nRomilly, whose services to English literature have won for him the\\r\\ngratitude of scholars.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf each generation of writers between the accession of Elizabeth and the\\r\\npresent time, several of the most conspicuous names are either found on\\r\\nthe rolls of the inns, or are closely associated in the minds of\\r\\nstudents with the life of the law-colleges. Shakspeare\\'s plays abound\\r\\nwith testimony that he was no stranger in the legal inns, and the rich\\r\\nvein of legal lore and diction that runs through his writings has\\r\\ninduced more judicious critics than Lord Campbell to conjecture that he\\r\\nmay at some early time of his career have directed his mind to the\\r\\nstudy, if not the practice, of the law. Amongst Elizabethan writers who\\r\\nbelonged to inns may be mentioned--George Ferrars, William Lambarde, Sir\\r\\nHenry Spelman, and that luckless pamphleteer John Stubbs, all of whom\\r\\nwere members of Lincoln\\'s Inn; Thomas Sackville, Francis Beaumont the\\r\\nYounger, and John Ferne, of the Inner Temple; Walter Raleigh, of the\\r\\nMiddle Temple; Francis Bacon, Philip Sidney, George Gascoyne, and\\r\\nFrancis Davison, of Gray\\'s Inn. Sir John Denham, the poet, became a\\r\\nLincoln\\'s-Inn student in 1634; and Francis Quarles was a member of the\\r\\nsame learned society. John Selden entered the Inner Temple in the second\\r\\nyear of James I., where in due course he numbered, amongst his literary\\r\\ncontemporaries,--William Browne, Croke, Oulde, Thomas Gardiner, Dynne,\\r\\nEdward Heywood, John Morgan, Augustus Cæsar, Thomas Heygate, Thomas May,\\r\\ndramatist and translator of Lucan\\'s \\'Pharsalia,\\' William Rough and Rymer\\r\\nwere members of Gray\\'s Inn. Sir John David and Sir Simonds D\\'Ewes\\r\\nbelonged to the Middle Temple. Massinger\\'s dearest friends lived in the\\r\\nInner Temple, of which society George Keate, the dramatist, and Butler\\'s\\r\\nstaunch supporter William Longueville, were members. Milton passed the\\r\\nmost jocund hours of his life in Gray\\'s Inn, in which college Cleveland\\r\\nand the author of \\'Hudibras\\' held the meetings of their club. Wycherley\\r\\nand Congreve, Aubrey and Narcissus Luttrell were Inns-of-Court men. In\\r\\nlater periods we find Thomas Edwards, the critic; Murphy, the dramatic\\r\\nwriter; James Mackintosh, Francis Hargrave, Bentham, Curran, Canning, at\\r\\nLincoln\\'s Inn. The poet Cowper was a barrister of the Temple. Amongst\\r\\nother Templars of the eighteenth century, with whose names the\\r\\nliterature of their time is inseparably associated, were Henry Fielding,\\r\\nHenry Brooke, Oliver Goldsmith, and Edmund Burke. Samuel Johnson resided\\r\\nboth in Gray\\'s Inn and the Temple, and his friend Boswell was an\\r\\nadvocate of respectable ability as well as the best biographer on the\\r\\nroll of English writers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foregoing are but a few taken from hundreds of names that illustrate\\r\\nthe close union of Law and Literature in past times. To lengthen the\\r\\nlist would but weary the reader; and no pains would make a perfect\\r\\nmuster roll of all the literary lawyers and _legal littérateurs_ who\\r\\neither are still upon the stage, or have only lately passed away. In\\r\\ntheir youth four well-known living novelists--Mr. William Harrison\\r\\nAinsworth, Mr. Shirley Brooks, Mr. Charles Dickens, and Mr. Benjamin\\r\\nDisraeli--passed some time in solicitors\\' offices. Mr. John Oxenford was\\r\\narticled to an attorney. Mr. Theodore Martin resembles the authors of\\r\\n\\'The Rejected Addresses\\' in being a successful practitioner in the\\r\\ninferior branch of the law. Mr. Charles Henry Cooper was a successful\\r\\nsolicitor. On turning over the leaves to that useful book, \\'Men of the\\r\\nTime,\\' the reader finds mention made of the following men of letters and\\r\\nlaw--Sir Archibald Alison, Mr. Thomas Chisholm Anstey, Mr. William\\r\\nEdmonstone Aytoun, Mr. Philip James Bailey, Mr. J.N. Ball, Mr. Sergeant\\r\\nPeter Burke, Sir J.B. Burke, Mr. John Hill Burton, Mr. Hans Busk, Mr.\\r\\nIsaac Butt, Mr. George Wingrove Cooke, Sir E.S. Creasy, Dr. Dasent, Mr.\\r\\nJohn Thaddeus Delane, Mr. W. Hepworth Dixon, Mr. Commissioner\\r\\nFonblanque, Mr. William Forsyth, Q.C., Mr. Edward Foss, Mr. William\\r\\nCarew Hazlitt, Mr. Thomas Hughes, Mr. Leone Levi, Mr. Lawrence\\r\\nOliphant, Mr. Charles Reade, Mr. W. Stigant, Mr. Tom Taylor, Mr.\\r\\nMcCullagh Torrens, Mr. M.F. Tupper, Dr. Travers, Mr. Samuel Warren, and\\r\\nMr. Charles Weld. Some of the gentlemen in this list are not merely\\r\\nnominal barristers, but are practitioners with an abundance of business.\\r\\nAmongst those to whom the editor of \\'Men of the Time\\' draws attention as\\r\\n\\'Lawyers,\\' and who either are still rendering or have rendered good\\r\\nservice to literature, occur the names of Sir William A\\'Beckett, Mr. W.\\r\\nAdams, Dr. Anster, Sir Joseph Arnould, Sir George Bowyer, Sir John\\r\\nColeridge, Mr. E. W. Cox, Mr. Wilson Gray, Mr. Justice Haliburton, Mr.\\r\\nThomas Lewin, Mr. Thomas E. May, Mr. J.G. Phillimore, Mr. James Fitz\\r\\nJames Stephen, Mr. Vernon Harcourt, Mr. James Whiteside. Some of the\\r\\ndistinguished men mentioned in this survey have already passed to\\r\\nanother world since the publication of the last edition of \\'Men of the\\r\\nTime;\\' but their recorded connexion with literature as well as law no\\r\\nless serves to illustrate an important feature of our social life. It is\\r\\nalmost needless to remark that the names of many of our ablest anonymous\\r\\nwriters do not appear in \\'Men of the Time.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A BOOK ABOUT LAWYERS ***\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\r\\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\r\\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in\\r\\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\\r\\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\\r\\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\\r\\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\\r\\nor any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or\\r\\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any\\r\\nDefect you cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
