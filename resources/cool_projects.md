## Go Randno
### By Ben Grosser

[![Go Rando](https://www.creativeapplications.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/go-rando-noise-1920x1080-e1487954638349.png)](https://vimeo.com/202612867)

> Go Rando is a web browser extension that obfuscates your feelings on Facebook. Every time you click “Like”, Go Rando randomly chooses one of the six “reactions” for you. Over time, you appear to Facebook’s algorithms as someone whose feelings are emotionally “balanced” – as someone who feels Angry as much as Haha or Sad as much as Love. You can still choose a specific reaction if you want to, but even that choice will be obscured by an emotion profile increasingly filled with noise. In other words, Facebook won’t know if your reaction was genuine or not. Want to see what Facebook feels like when your emotions are obscured? Then go rando!


## Searches
### By Ishac Bertran

![Searches](http://ishback.com/searches/searches1.jpg)

Ishac has produced a series of books containing his Google search entries for the past 6 years – like a diary he’s been writing, unconsciously. Whereas the book is not available for download, you can create your own Searches book by following [these instructions](https://github.com/ishback/Searches).

> In 2020 I made a piece of software called ‘Thresho’. It’s a utility that records everything you play in the studio. Once the audio level reaches a certain threshold, it’s recording, then stops once it’s below. E.g. if I just stood up and mashed some keys on the synth right now, it’d record what I just did. It then puts the recording, timestamped, into a folder so you can access it later.

> Thresho turned my creative process on its head. It allowed me the freedom to experiment without having to think about what the sound I’m developing might become. I’d just be endlessly adding recordings to this ever-expanding sound bank, which I was able to dip into at my leisure.

> However, I began to notice that, over the course of writing the album, this expanding bank of recordings was starting to become like an intricate audio journal. The software had generated a really detailed, timestamped, personal musical memoir.

> ‘Tread’ is, in part, named after this resulting memoir; the process of writing was continually leaving these prints behind me. And while I think the album serves its purpose in referencing this, I want people to be able to engage with the recordings further to get a deeper understanding of the album’s concept.

> So, I’ve decided I’m going to share them with you all.

> There’s about 2000 recordings (50GB), so there is a website in the works dedicated to specifically housing it all. From the site you’ll be able to scroll to a specific date & time, listen to, and download all the recordings for free.

> _Internet machine_ is a multi-screen film about the invisible infrastructures of the internet. The film reveals the hidden materiality of our data by exploring some of the machines through which ‘the cloud’ is transmitted and transformed.

> In this film I wanted to look beyond the childish myth of ‘the cloud’, to investigate what the infrastructures of the internet actually look like. It felt important to be able to see and hear the energy that goes into powering these machines, and the associated systems for securing, cooling and maintaining them.

## The Crystallisation Event – Endless digitisation and supersaturation of data
### Jayson Haebich

> _The Crystallisation Event_ explores a speculative future in which the endless digitisation and quantification of data has caused information to become supersaturated and begin a process of crystallisation. The project is presented as a speculative museum exhibit showing future artefacts from this post crystallised data world.

> An autonomous twitter account that, one by one, lists and follows every single twitter user in order of their twitter ID number. An archive of the archive. A reminder that you are a number in a vast database. A sorting of social media that is not based on real relationships but arguably a more honest listing of our relationship to the banality of computational infrastructure.

## What the Frog's Nose Tells the Frog's Brain
### Tega Brain

![Smelly](https://payload.cargocollective.com/1/10/351441/5364812/Brain-FrogsNose1b.jpg)

> How does data become information? How does perception influence how we understand the world and therefore respond to it?

> This work measures electricity use within a public building and translates this information into an olfactory experience. Smell is a sensation from which it is difficult to be intellectually distanced; by manifesting electricity information in this non-visual medium, this project explores the mechanics of perception. How data can be experienced? This work questions current approaches to interface design and the creation of 'seamless' user experiences.

## Intergovernmental Panel on Capitalism - IPC
### Tega Brain and Sam Lavigne

![IPC](https://freight.cargo.site/w/1500/q/75/i/292c6716851a62313da03354b6ae60ca2fed3dc7505e986062de7479e6fe0e8d/2.jpg)

> [The Intergovernmental Panel on Capitalism (IPC)](http://intergovernmentalpaneloncapitalism.org/) recognizes the problem of adequately addressing climate change as the problem of addressing deregulated capitalism. The IPC is a speculative organization that appears in the image of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading international body for the assessment of climate change as founded by the United Nations in 1988. We reframe their mission through an ambitious attempt to edit all of their online material, replacing every instance of the phrase "climate change" with the word “capitalism". These edits are made in the pdfs of the IPCC reports and in all web and video content, providing a glimpse of a world where capitalism itself is called into question.

## Mapping Wikipedia
### Michael Mandiberg

> The site’s editors are disproportionately cis white men from the global North.

> Every time anyone edits Wikipedia, the software records the text added or removed, the time of the edit, and the username of the editor. (This edit history is part of Wikipedia’s ethos of radical transparency: Everyone is anonymous, and you can see what everyone is doing.) When an editor isn’t logged in with a username, the software records that user’s IP address. I parsed all of the 884 million edits to English Wikipedia to collect and geolocate the 43 million IP addresses that have edited English Wikipedia.

## Print Wikipedia
### Michael Mandiberg

> Print Wikipedia (2009-16) is a both a utilitarian visualization of the largest accumulation of human knowledge to date - the Wikipedia database - and a poetic gesture toward the challenges of knowing in the age of big data. To create the piece, I wrote software that transforms Wikipedia's entire English-language database into 7,473 volumes of 700 pages each and then uploads them for print-on-demand. It draws attention to the sheer size of the encyclopedia's content and the impossibility of rendering Wikipedia as a material object in fixed form: by the time a volume is printed, it is already out of date.

> New York Apartment combines the totality of New York real estate into a single website, sourced from every single for-sale listing in New York City. The site includes hundreds of thousands of images, video tours, descriptive sentences, 3d structures generated from extruded floor plans, and a mortgage calculator.

> The Clock by artist Christian Marclay is a 24-hour long montage of thousands of film clips that depict clocks or reference time. The film has been edited so that it is a functioning timepiece. Watch it and you will find that the time displayed on screen will be the same as on your watch or smartphone.

>I waste time scrolling mindlessly on Instagram, spending hours scrolling on my phone in the dark in bed especially when moods are low. Social media rewires our brains; optimising big-tech companies' engagement algorithms by reducing our social attention, making us increasingly self-conscious, depressed and even sometimes radicalised. These images are a visual representation of ‘doom-scrolling’, of what happens when wasted time is turned into a physical scroll of time.

## Gender Shades

[Paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf)
>The Gender Shades project evaluates the accuracy of AI powered gender classification products. This evaluation focuses on gender classification as a motivating example to show the need for increased transparency in the performance of any AI products and services that focused on human subjects. Bias in this context is defined as having practical differences in gender classification error rates between groups.
