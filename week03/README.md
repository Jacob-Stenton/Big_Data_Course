### Learning Objectives:

- API and HTTP recap
- Databases recap
- Use skills we have learnt in the weeks so far to make a more meaningful and automated system: a web-crawler.


### Homework:

- Finish the Exercises in the Notebook
- Get a new link source as your starting point. To take it further, find a more meaningful direction in your crawling. Perhaps you could actually read what words are in the link, or in the page or find something which would allow your web crawler to make a decision about where it would like to go to next.It would also be great to _store this journey. Perhaps some more metadata into a text file. Perhaps the web-crawler doesn't only move forward but can turn back (return to an older link) and start a new path.
- Try to document this journey in the notebook
